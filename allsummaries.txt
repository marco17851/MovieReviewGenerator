"There Is So Much Darkness Now ~ Come For The Miracle"
Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production
This movie needed to be made.
distantly based on a real tragedy

Excellent movie!!! Go watch it!!!
If it Ain't Broke.........
Read the Book, Seen the Movie
Excellent Movie
Superb
Just like the book, except for the whole concept thing
Swashbuckling intensity that never lets up
A very weak adaption of the novel
We Are All Either Kings Or Pawns In The Game Of Life
Good movie, mediocre Action movie.
A good movie to see
Entertaining and fun...
Ain't payback a- well, you know...
BREATHTAKING...THEY JUST DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE
A butchery of the book
They didn't  read the novel before they wrote this BOMB!!!
Internal Strength encompassed in a "guys" movie
Another example of why books should not be made into movies
Critics are wrong
wrong area
count of Monte cristo
Dysfunctional DVD
Deplorable Adaptation
The Count of Hollywood
Hopefully you will get a good disc
Good..But please don't call it "Faithful"
Great Book by Dumas, horrible movie.
A good effort, but ultimately cheesy and unlike the novel
did they even read the book?
Revenge can kill you, yet it's what kept him alive...
a true product of Hollywood
Dumbed-down and gloomy
Not A Great Re-Make!
They've trashed yet another masterpiece
Good movie but,
A fine adaption of the Dumas classic
Its not like the book
Love this Film
Weak retelling of classic story
At last...a romantic movie without the dirty smut
Good Adaption Of Revenge Classic
Old-Fashioned Movie Fun!
The Count gets my vote for outstanding Picture of the Year!
Revenge is God's Justice....but he is in charge
Good cast and scenery don't make up for a story so far removed from Mr Dumas' incredible book
This is what happens when you cram a classic into a matinee
This Counts as a Classic
Classic Score!
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

Some interesting twists on the Alexander Dumas classic

Likable, but Lacks Originality
Better than I expected

Decent but no Kurosawa
I can't believe you don't own this already!
Watchable stuff (you can save the hara kiri for later, Tom)
Don't miss this film
Entertaining, semi-accurate samurai adventure

Dances with Wolves, but not in a "slap in the face" way
Far more then I expected.
No cheese or gratuitous ANYTHINg in this film.
The Essence of the Samurai
The Last Samurai is brilliant!
Saw the Sneak Peak of it Last Night...Loved It!!!
A Damm Good Movie!!

unoriginal and empty
Simply Amazing!!!

Great Movie
Tom Cruise can do anything!
EAST MEETS WEST A GOOD MEETING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I guess it may have resembled DWW somewhat
The Good/ The Bad/ The Ugly
Best movie that was shot in NZ ever.
beauty hides a less than suitable point
DANCES WITH WOLVES Part 2!
worth a try
Excellent, if you are open minded about other cultures.
A Spiritual Journey from the West to the East
Cruise on the Epic Level
Pretty silly
One dimensional
Cruising Japan
I know the Japanese are accomodating, but this is ridiculous!
Extra care taken--Bubble Wrap!!
el ultimo samurai emn bluray
LIke this movie for it's portrayal of PTSD
very good movie
Great MOVIE!!!
...
An Absolute Buyer
A CUT ABOVE!
A near-great samurai epic!
Quasi-historic costume drama
Expected to hate it -- loved it!
Tom the Swashbuckler!
Try this one on for size...
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"
Where are the American Samurais?
Spectacular but predictable epic.
Dances with wolves but further "east"
Disappointing
Deja vu, anyone?
pretty weak
Honor
Hollywood Trying to make a film about honor?  Please
should give it a 2, but it was ok, and it could have been SOOOOO much better.
Keeps your attention, but don't buy for your collection
poor sound
Not right for the academy
Wow.
Good action movie, but not family friendly.
Wonderful and Spectacular
Very pretty
Beautiful to look at
Total Hollywood
confused
Dances with the Samurai
No research whatsoever
Trite and Been-done-before
The best!
Tom Cruise in his best movie!
A great movie to watch
Great
Fake and pretentious.
Unfortunelty not &quot;The Last Tom Cruise Movie&quot;
Twisted history and morality
The Journey of a Lost Soul and the Story a Dying Culture
The most ironic film of the year
Mocks Japan While Claiming to be "Sympathetic"
Pathetically misguided
Cool
Great movie, but very Disappointing DVD
Dumb and pretentious
beautiful photography, but . . .
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure",
DVD THE LAST SAMURAI
The story sucks, but, um... It has Ninjas!
Good movie
Good movie gone Ronin
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"
"SAKI"
An American in Japan
Great Film, If Not Historically Accurate
NOT TRUE SAMURAI
Pretty Good Movie, but...
Tokyo goes Hollywood
Good Story; Bad Execution
See TC play in the mud
The Last Samurai
better left to others......
The Last Samurai or Tom Cruise's Pathetic Bid for an Oscar
Dances with Samurais
This Prison Moon
Beautiful and solid, but not great
This movie sucked
The Last Samurai
Beautifully shot  ~~, if only TCruises character could be.
GOOD IDEA, BUT IT GOES ON TOO LONG
a+
why bother...
Just Another Anti-West Film
Awful
Last Samurai as seen by the racist dunb kitty
Tarzan redux
Here's the Remade Version Playing in Japan and Asia....
Awful
Terrible...
A little to familiar
The Highest Definition!!!
A film about Samurai from Hollywood.  Now that WOULD be something...
Pretentious movie with Hollywood romantizing unfound concept
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"
Omg...very hurtful and insulting.
0 stars but alas that is not possible...
Who? Tom Cruise. Who?
The Last Samurai
Good Movie
beautiful movie in HD
Add this to your DVD collection!
I liked this movie!
Of Shame  and Honor - Cruise's Conflict
Wow! Great Movie &amp; Lots of Extra Features
This film was amazing!!!
Flawed, but worthy
good Hollywood movie
The Last Samurai [Blu-ray]
Stunning
This is the version to get.
Gumnaam Review
Interesing Movie
A classic!
I really can't say anything but "wow"...
GUMNAMM
Monsters, Virus Outbreaks, and a Girl with an Eyepatch
Not the best adaptation actually. It's lacking.
Does not feel complete
Catchy Virus
great show, bad ending
Good Story But With A Not-So-Good Ending.
Very strong beginning, very poor ending.
Venus versus Virus
Great anime To short
A bit of everything and done pretty well.
If you love the show this is for you
Enter Louise Brooks
Sterling crashes a Ford
THIS VIDEO IS A MUST WATCH! 2 THUMBS WAYYYY UP!!
Great getting started video
Unlocks the Keyboard for Everyone!
The best piano course
Piano for Quitters
Terminator Salvation
Explosions, or how skynet meets transformers!
Gritty
Terminator Salvation
Great movie
Entertaining enough
MN Nice
Mindless fun, but leaves you with a lot of (pointless) questions...
I love it
Not bad, but still... the weakest of the Terminator movies!
I must for T fans
Liked the movie
Terminator Salvation Does Not Disappoint
terminator with a vision
Enjoy it a lot!
Good Re-visit To The Past...
Best in the series
Terminate This!
Nice Addition
Terminator: Salvation (2009)
Was tense during my first time!
Terminator Salvation
Terminator 4
Director's movie vision clearer in DVD than in theatrical release
An interesting installment in the Terminator series
Terminator Salvation
It's better on Blueray
STARRING...Special effects
Better Than i thought it was gonna be
Pretty good movie..
Terminator Salvation (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]
Interesting
Great movie with lots of action.
In Need of Salvation
Slam bam thank you ma'am
I really, really enjoyed this movie! But...
Terminator Salvation
I forgot how good it is
The Worst Terminator Film to Date
The fourth film in the series. DVD.
I really liked this film. Most misunderstood film of the year?
Disappointment For the Longtime Fan...
The "Termination" of a franchise!
A Struggling Series.
Explosions, Explosions, and More (Explosions)
There is no Salvation for this Terminator flick
action ad nauseum
Terminate the franchise
A humdrum entry to a disenfranchised franchise
"This isn't the future my mother warned me about"
Shame on Fox and WB
The Alien vs Predator of the Terminator series.
A Worthy Addition To A Much Loved Franchise.
What a Waste of First Rate Talent and a Great Film Series
So much potential!
Superb
awesome
Loved it!
Great Movie with awesome actors
Better than I expected
Salvation from the Terminators!
great movie
terminator salvation
Made an excellent Christmas Present
Director's cut even better than the theatrical
Terminator Salvation: Fire (special effects) without much light
Terminator...the Rebuilding of a Franchise
The War For Survival Rages On...
A fresh rebirth with a new direction....
Loved it, no matter what others think!
It was a great movie!!
confusing and depressing
Terminated
Okay, but not the best.
one of the best terminator movies yet
Why did they bother to buy this franchise?
If you can hear this YOU are the Resistance
For those who love the series
Terminator Salvation....
A Worthy Addition to the Terminator Franchise
Not great, but better than I expected
this movie is action-packed from beginning to end.
Hope it terminated the series
This is a GREAT action movie
The best Terminator movie
Rehash of other films
Entertaining, and not the worst entry in the series, but not as good as you'd hope.
rememberable summer movie
Glad but yet also sad
Poor excuse for a Terminator movie and movie in general!
Terminator Salvation was a let down.
Weak.
McG destroys a perfect franchise (and my childhood)
Exquisite, Intelligent, Evocative Sci-Fi
Good Start.......For A New Trilogy
Was this supposed to have a plot?
Honorable end to a great franchise
Flimsy, Unoriginal, Forgettable Film...
Franchise Terminated
Why does McG keep getting work?
Director's Cut Differences
good movie, but not much to Director's Cut
Terminator Salvation Extended cut
An Imperfect, But Still Above-Average Summer Actioner
The best version, but still a bit light on features....
NO DIGITAL COPY
DVD EXTRAS? What happened to them? (*Good movie, better than T3, but not so good DVD)
Decent film, terrible DVD
The best Terminator movie since T2
Pointless
another solid movie in the series
great movie -- five stars!
Best of all the Terminator movies
ONLY FOR THE DIE HARD FANS
not nearly as bad as people say
Wasn't expecting to Enjoy it but I did!
Sour Disaster
No story means don't waste your time
Is this the best they can do?
Slow Delivery
Terminator Salvation
Ehhhhh
No fate
Con esta pelicula, se salv&oacute; la saga de TERMINATOR (por eso es que se llama SALVATION)
Better than the original, but not much added
Good Movie
My favorite of the series.
full quality
Admirable entry
"Pretty Good Sequel!"
The definition of bittersweet
WIll become a cult classic
excelent movie
Terminator Salvation
Terminator Salvation (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] by Christian Bale
GREAT MOVIE
Good Movie...Not Great!
Really enjoyed this movie
well done!
Redemption After Horrible T3!
A worthwhile effort but flawed
great movie
terminator salvation
Terminator Salvation review
Awesome
Terminator salvation
excellent service
Great Movie
That Terminator has more juice
DECENT MOVIE
Salvation
Good but not like t1 & t2
GOOD PLOT, GOOD ACTING, GOOD ENTERTAINMENT WHILE KEEPING THE PREVIOUS THEME IN TACT
Best McG movie ever but no director's cut
Terminator Salvation
Made a great gift!
Walks The Fine Line Between Paying Homage And Adding To The Cannon
5 for 5
Great!
pretty good action...
Good action movie
spans the time
Better the second time around; pretty on Blu
Hollywood should have consulted me....
like but not love
Actually a lot better than I expected...
Mindless Fun
A charitable 3 stars at that.
Nothing great, nothing horrible
Solid Movie
Waiting for a long time
A Futuristic Action Romp in the Terminator Mythos
Terminator: Target
Pretty Faithful To The Franchise Despite The Director
If only this movie had a heart as strong as Marcus Wright's
Great Action, Good Story
The Terminator? No Way. Good Flick? Totally
Back to the Future
What a let down!!
The real danger is in human beings
No Scene Selection, Can't Escape Previews & Ads
Not bad at all
Was This Supposed to be "The Transformers Got Lost in Time?"
There is a Skynet... and it wrote this movie
Not Cameron's Vision
Definitely second best of the entire series...
DVD gets hosed again!!!
I terminated it at 32:31.
A good sendoff to a sadly dead franchise
Dissapointing
Step up from Terminator 3?  Yesss
Lackluster Terminator outing
Man and machine battle for the control of destroyed Earth
i have few issues with this part
GOOD, GOOD MOVIE!  (plus confession...)
Good job McG
This makes up for T3
Continuity?  I can't find it here.
He loved it!!
Half-reboot, half-sequel, all-terrible
Ok
Bare Bones DVD
A Disappointmentator
Better than everyone told me it was
One of these things is not like the others...
Digital copy NOT w/ Purchase & Hard to Obtain.
a movie that lacks feeling, like the terminator itself
as good as T2
No fate but what we make
An Awesome Action Film!!!
Where they kidding?
I love Blu-ray, but don't force it on me to get the Director's Cut.
Entertaining with sloppy editing and storyline
Terminator: Salvation
They should really Terminate the franchise after this
Awesome!
Unless you're a major fan of the series, don't bother wasting your money buying the dvd.
All action, no heart
A worthy sequel to a great franchise..
Blu as it's meant to be
Did anyone making this film see original terminator?
Beating the dead horse
Zero stars and I want a refund.
Rent it (unless it's cheaper to buy it "previously viewed")
Now we're talkin'...
Finally, the Terminator setting we've all been waiting for!
Part Fallout 3, part Transformers, part Road Warrior = Terminator Salvation IMO
T4(Salvation) is in the right spot as the 4th movie
Factory fighting scene again
Total Rubbish, don't waste your money
Terminator "Lite"
Terrible....Just Terrible
A solid action flick that neither lifts nor sinks the Terminator saga
I guess I'm suppose to watch the new Transformers film next?  Could it be worse than the first one?
not a big fan of the first three
Director's Cut Offers Nothing!! * Some Spoilers in this Review*
Been a harsh critic in the past, but...
Hell of a lot better than T3!
Terminator Salvation
What was the point of the movie?
not what it claims
Great Audio and Video
Great movie.
TERMINATOR SALVATION
Terminator Salvation
Good Continuation
Good action movie for Terminator fans
good, but the series may be exhausting its potential
Good "extension" with a moving Worthington performance
Terminator Review:
Terminator Salvation
Not the story I expected!!
Movie review
Great movie, Worth every penny!
John Connor or Batman
Is it a prequel? Or a sequel?
"Win or lose, this war ends tonight!"
Great presentation for a mediocre film
THE BEST REVIEW
So Much Action - So Little Time
Excellent!
Compromised prequel/sequel in the "Terminator" saga has its moments and strong cast
Not the best
The Return of the Killing Machines
Surprised at how horrible this movie is.  Terrible acting, script and directing
Ugh
What an awful movie...
Utter B.S.
Great Movie
Worst terminator movie
POORLY LIT SCENES RUINS THE MOVIE FURTHER!
Sci-Fi
The cup is either half full or half empty......
The Best Terminator Yet!!!!!
Good action sequences... pity about the plot
No need to discuss the plot; it's absent
DVD release is a disaster
Terminate that Movie!
Been There. Done That.
leave it alone!!
best Terminator movie!
this is an awsome movie to see. a big must.
TERMINATOR SALVATION
excellent..best of the series
MOVIE
Not as good as the other 3
directors cut
Stick with the original two!
Horrible!
Why am I not in this movie?
Very good....but....
Terminator DVD  release sucks
You better be ready to pull the trigger........
"OHHHH GOOD FOR YOU!
James Cameron For T5?
An Awesome Action Film!!!
A complete letdown
what a waste
Terminator Salvation
waste of plastic
WHERE ARE THE BONUS FEATURES??? SERIOUSLY!
Terrible flick!
Lighten up folks, it's a popcorn flick
Save Your Money!
A very slick action film
the german edition is much better
A combonation of all 3 previous films in one and not in a good way
Didn't get it...
Way Out There...
Not Suspenseful + Not engaging and exiciting as Terminator 2
Great DVD
The weakest of the bunch
A Disappointing Continuation of the Series
Different DVD versions
A worthy addition to the Terminator series....
I bought the directors cut DVD at Target today.
AWESOME!
Excellent Video Quality
I am a fan so of course I enjoyed the Movie!
Director's Cut is pretty worthless
horrible movie
Epic fail.
This is what happens when...
Get the Terminator Salvation (Two-Disc Director's Cut + Digital Copy)
Special effects very nice but stupidity ruins the movie
Arrived early
Terrible Addition to the Terminator Franchise
Wow
Cuidado Brasileiros
Amazon Sent Me the Wrong Version
Boycott to this movie
OMG
lacking
ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE !!!!!!
Saw this down in Orlando, FL
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR
Ending... (No Spoilers here)
I like to call for a swap
Not the best Terminator movie but I will buy the BluRay
..
One Of The Worst Movies Of The Last 12 Years, Avoid At All Costs
GOD This movie SUCKED
Great movie, Great price
GARBAGE. IT MAKES T3 LOOK LIKE A MASTERPEICE.....
I hope this is not the end of the franchise
Action over substance
Terrific War Scenes and Fantastic Special Effects!
More like 3 1/2 stars...just sayin'...
Terminator Salvation
All right...
I Actually Enjoyed This
An average release for an average movie
WEAKEST OF ALL TERMINATOR FILMS
Awesome Movie
A movie worth owning
Exceptionable But Completely Different Feel
The Salvation of the T Series
salvation for some
One of the best in the series...
Good
John Connor Blah - Marcus Wright AWESOME
Where is your Salvation?
MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE!
The Dark side of John Conner's Mission
What where they Thinking?!
A mediocre sequel to the series, but not as bad as T3
machine killin' good time
Thought this would terminate my Terminator viewing...NOPE!
Terminator Salvation Review
Surprisingly good film!
Phenomenal 4th film
I doubt they will be back !
DVD Extras
An Awesome Action Film!!!
Not the traditional Terminator...but great anyway
There is no Salvation for this Terminator flick
First 3 movies great, the 4th an absolute disapointment
Terminator Salvation in Blue Ray Fails to Deliver HD quality
Not quite the train wreck I was expecting
Great new addition to the Terminator franchise
Post-Judgement Day Entertainment
Not much "Director's Cut"
Something to watch, but nothing to pay for
Not much personality to this flick...more like a video game.
Fairly Solid Movie Almost Ruined By a Poor Ending
Unusually good!
Terminator:Salvation  ( Blu-Ray )
Looks good less filling
great movie
salvation terminator
Give It Another Shot If You Didn't Like It At First; I Did And Really Enjoyed It

Very Interesting similarities.
No matter what you think of the film
Did it really happen?
communion dvd
This World Is Nothing Like You Think It Is
Communion (Special Collector's Edition) (1989)-Just OK.
Worth Buying. based on a real incident.
Communion
Not bad....
Not Very Coherent, But Very Unsettling
Walken Makes This Movie Barely Worth It
Leave the lights on at bedtime after watching this.
Weirdest movie ever
Horrendous Letdown

Popcorn Sci-Fi Fun
not for all taste,but i really liked it
A cross between Star Wars and Mad Max.
Spazz-hunter...
Not as bad as 'Men In Black'
Great Sci-fi classic
yet another unexpected favorite coming to DVD
Wow!  An action movie with a pacing problem.
Quite good...
Better than DIRTY JOBS!

BEST NEW FILM
A great movie, better animated than the first!
Familiarly Different
Excels from the original on a few points
Beautiful remake of the classic....

Great Premise, Worst Actual Story Ever
Cool Movie
Awesome
Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust
Fantastic

There Isn't an Option for 4 1/2 Stars, but 5 will do.....

BLOOD LUST THIS

Best anime to come out since Ninja Scroll
Not Quite Holy
vampire hunter D , GOTHSTAR  .
Not as good as the first . . .
Great movie, but worst encoding quality ever on a DVD
beautiful indeed, but little more than that
2 stars for graphics, 1 star for plot.
Wow! Freakin Incredible!
Where's the "professional dialogue" option?
not that great
THE BEST ANIME OF THE YEAR
equally superior to the first despite the sound quality
Good Story.......That's all folks!!
DUB ONLY?!  YOU MEAN THEY *THREW AWAY* THE ORIGINAL AUDIO?!
Why bother

No Japanese

Summary
Ole
VERY HELPFUL....REALLY NICE!!
educational
A True American Ninja and Hero.
Nana great music and acting!
Awsome!!!
The Genuine Article
You must own this series -Jult Warfell
Jim is alive
Doors fan or not, see it for Kilmer's performance alone
Surreal take on mythic personality
The Music and a little bit more
a must have
Great
The Rise and Fall Of The Legendary Doors. Well Done!
VAL KILMER NAILS HIS ROLE MEANT FOR HIM!
Opening The Doors
Really Awesome Movie
Where is/was the REAL Jim Morrison
Oliver Stone
a classic
"ALRIIIGGHHHTTT!!!"
Val Kilmer's best performance
An incredible ride
Val Kilmer at his best
The Doors
You can feel  the torment,passion and destiny
best depiction of 60s and rock n roll
The Doors: One of Oliver Stone's best films!
The Same Doors
A Must-See for All Fans
Morrison's Show
"why don't we say, baby you can't bite my wire?"
Anamorphic for 16x9 this time?
Snakes, Indians and Witches...
The Doors (Special Edition)
The Arrow Flies and Falls
Stone almost ruins Kilmer's finest hour
Val Kilmer at his BEST.
WOW...Turn back time
I'll Make This One Fast
End of Stone's 60's Trilogy
open the door for this one, it's good
The Doors rock!
Captivating
The Doors (special edition)
excellent evocation of 60s aspiration and excess
A Life of its own.
The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack
Nice!!
&quot;Out here in the perimeter, there are no stars...&quot;
Head Trip
you decide
"The Doors"  Light Up the Screen.......
mostly reviewing the new features
GREAT PICTURE & SOUND!
"Does Anyone Really Know?" ~ Shamanic Excess And The Lizard King
Similar contradictions and problems I have with most of Stone's movies...
This film ONLY shows the 'wild,' spaced-out, abusive side of Jim Morrison
Accurate?  Who Cares!
A Great Movie
A Comic Book Version of A Unique Talent
Stoned--but not exactly immaculate
Get Stoned!
worthless, with the exception of what Kilmer and Meg Ryan do here
Incoherent, negative, and not really about THE DOORS...
"Change the mood from glad to sadness"
Although I live in the subconscious, our pale reason hides the infinite from us
Surprisingly tedious
a must watch for everyone born under the sun
If you like The Doors or Jim Morrison stay away as far as possible from this item
The Door to The Doors
fine movie.  if only jim could have been here to portray himself
Long, Boring, No Focus on Music
Bad DVD quality
Great Movie for Boomers
The icon of a generation!
*Groovy Movie*
Break On Through to the Otherside
Terrific! Oliver Stone outdoes himself and V.Kilmer is great
An entertaining movie!
It was OK, but...
Colorful film
The Door -  Val Kilmer
A reply review
INCREDIBLE!
A true poet...
The Movie That Makes You A Fan!
...
How do you know you are alive....?
One brilliant work of genius whose immortal spirit can never be defeated
The Movie of my favorite band plus directed by movie making king oliver Stone how could it get any better!
AMAZING
Doors fans this is a must have
Lizard King
Overlong & indulgent--but Kilmer is brilliant
Thanks a lot, Oliver Stone
Val Kilmer&#65533;s best performance.
Drugs, Depression, Opportunity Lost
The Boors
Boo, Hiss - Fake Widescreen
Absolutely horrible movie with plodding disjointed script
IN THE MIDST OF LIFE WE ARE IN DEATH
VAL KILMER IS JIM MORRISON!!!!
Roaming Dogs In Heat ... Cold Grinding Grizzly Bear Jaws
In response to reviwer J.C. Hoyt's complaint,
"the doors" HATED IT!
negative "one," really
could have been much better
An Interesting but Inaccurate Portrayal
"Motel Money Murder Madness..."
Oliver Stone is drunk on Jim Morrison
This Is an Inaccurate Movie
In between, there are doors
Great movie..Horrible transfer..NO EXCUSE FOR THIS..DO NOT BUY
Good, But Could Have Been A Lot Better...
Jim Morrison: "I believe in excess... "
Is the Aspect Ratio Correct?
Strange Days
Decadent, Vibrant, Stylish And Visually Brilliant.
Much To Take In.
Kilmer's Brilliance...
An Award Winning performance...
Good movie
Despite A Few Inaccuracies, A Good Movie
Bored out of my gourd
I'm giving it 3 stars... and that's being generous
Oliver Stone captures us; but is it fact or fiction?
Movie was kinda fun and interesting, but...
good life story of jim morrison
&quot;ALRIIIGGHHHTTT!!!&quot;
RELIVING THE PHYCHADELIC ERA
Entertaining as a movie but hardly factual.
There Are Things Known, And Unknown
Great Movie But.........................................
Great Movie!
It all depends on what your expectations are going into it.
Kilmer Captivates
Don't Judge Until You Understand The Facts!
Unreal. Its really about Jim, and not the Doors however.
Wild Child
Oliver Stone is drunk on Jim Morrison
In between, there are doors
Indulgent and embellished biography of a modern folk hero
The greatest rock and roll film ever made!
The Doors of Perception
An Inaccurate Yet Entertaining History of The Doors
Good movie but not a balanced story
Good but some items misenterpreted
This is the end...
Absorbing movie - i didn't want it to end. (my only friend..
GREAT MOVIE!!!
a movie made it for the fans
Kilmer is Morrison
Good Job Kilmer
Westward Ho  (2 1/2 Stars)

Portrait of A One-of-a-Kind Artist in a One-of-a-Kind Decade
Bravo!  Bravissimo!
Good Documentary on The One And Only Nomi, the Singing Alien
interesting, though not intriguing
when music was still music, and New York was still New York
Fantastic
Saving The Human Race
Being a Klaus Nomi today is so much happier than it was before
A MUST SEE for old times sake !
Marvelous documentary on an unusual artist
I Was Wrong
THE way to know him
Klaus Nomi and the New york art scene in the 80's
Klaus Nomi, immortalized!!
Fascinating, poignant, but where is JOEY ARIAS?  DAVID BOWIE?
The Man from Outer Space
Great Movie
Get to know Nomi...
"If they saw my face would I still take a bow / Will they know me, know me, know me now"--The Nomi Song
Out of this world
Klaus Nomi: a cult of one
Interesting and quirky view of a genius kook.
Excellent Movie
To know him is to Love Him
We lost him too soon!
Pretty Kewl!
Only in New York
Cross Time Caper!
Prelude to a Storm
Not the best PR series, but a lot of fun
I Agree, maybe not the

Rubi, evil & beautiful!
Hot, trashy Mexican soap opera!

Gripping Psychological Horror Film
"One Of Michael Mann's Best!"
INTERESTING, BUT UNEVEN!
Manhunter review
Outstanding performance by William Peterson
A great thiller
GRIM AND GRIPPING PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER...
A great Murder Mystery
Creepy, but not quite "Red Dragon"
An OK movie, a GREAT book
good transfer...bad transfer

Mann is a highly underrated director...
The Toothfairy rules all
A modern classic
F-O-C-U-S !!!
One of the best thrillers ever made .......
The original and best version FINALLY on DVD!
Excellent film, but DO NOT bother buying the Limited Edition
Rating is for the movie, not Anchor Bay's destruction of it.
Yes, better than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;
Astonishing Unforgettable Glance Into Homicidial Dementia
Michael Mann's Take On The 'Hannibal Lector' Saga
Go ahead and buy the full screen edition
The Original Movie about the "Red Dragon"
A little too into its own psycobabbel but brian cox is outstanding
Best Hannibal Lecter Movie
Great but forgotten
Just As Good As The Others If Not Better
It's just Manhunter and me now sport!
The bar was set high right here...
Miami Vice with psychopaths
**now there are THREE versions**
The Greatest Movie Ever Of Its Genre!
manhunter
A Classic
good movie
The suspense and drama are well done
from the Thomas Harris book "Red Dragon"
Hopkins is still to come
The First 'Hannibal' On Screen
The tooth fairy strikes again!
How to learn about a serial killer, and learn about yourself
Manhunter (director's cut edition)
Divimax Treatment for a seminal 80s classic!
Petersen, Cox, Spinotti, Mann -- Masters at Work
Creepy and Intense
Underdone movie or overdone book?
Great movie with only a few flaws
michael manns' manhunter
...good
Dated &amp; Overrated
Manhunter - The First 'Red Dragon'
A  Claustrophobic  Mind-Game !
The 1-Disc MANHUNTER is the way to go
Great film tragic presentation.
Do I HAVE to give it a whole star?
Great thriller
Intense story and superb acting by Mr. Petersen
What if &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; was done ala &quot;Miami Vice&quot;?
Far superior to the film &quot;Red Dragon&quot;
Manhunter vs Red Dragon
Excellent Directing & Cinematography!
Spellbinding Thriller that Stands on its Own!
outstanding thriller
Could have been
Terrific Thriller no one saw.
Best of the Rest.
Best 80's detective film - Bar none
A 3-star movie with one demerit for this videocassette
Deserves more attention
Great thriller. Until the end.
The doctor is in...
What Most People Dont Understand is...
The Scariest Lecter
Rent it before you buy it
Suspenceful movie!!  Very true to the Book!!
A Must See Film!
Noo
A Great Original Film
Overrated 80's relic
BEST EVER
Enter the Dragon
Two stars out of sympathy.
One of the best flicks of all time....
I don't know what movie everyone else is watching, but...
Manhunter meets Red Dragon
Horrible
Soothing thriller
Well done
Breakthrough film...
Terrific film only slightly let down by undeserved transfer.
Better than Silence and Hannibal
Manhunter is a treat....
Taken on Its Own Merits
The best Thriller ever!
"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity."  "But I know none, and therefore I am no beast."  Richard III, Act 1, Scene 2
In many ways, a better thriller than &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;
Manhunter
SEE THIS BEFORE &quot;RED DRAGON&quot; IS RELEASED!
RESTORED DIRECTOR'S CUT DIVIMAX EDITION
It's Just You and Me Now, Sport.
William Petersen, the most underrated actor ever.
Before there was SILENCE, there was MANHUNTER
Intense Thriller
William Peterson ,Michael Mann
wow
An Overlook stroke of brilliance or Ying&Yang of Lector
Fine the way it is.
I like Michael Mann
Ponderous Thriller Falls Flat
"But be warned...
Hannibal the Cannibal meets Miami Vice
Prequal Silence of the Lambs Meets Miami Vice.
You decide...
William Petersen just isn't even a poor man's Jodie Foster.
I guess I missed it.
Decent but not great.
Interesting....... dated, but has some strengths - 2 Stars
If you loved Red Dragon, do yourself a favor and skip this
Comic Relief, Duran Duran Ikealand Version
Promising but underdeveloped
Inferior to "Red Dragon"
boring but creepy
Manhunter (or The Great Red Dragon)
Buy the version with the guy with the flashlight on the cover 1st.  True fans will also want to buy the Divimax version as well.
DON'T believe it every time they say "director's cut"
GRIM AND GRIPPING PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER...
Superior in every way to Silence of The Lambs!
Interesting, but if you like the film buy the other version!
[3.5]--The forgotten movie that is taken on its own terms
Absolutely Amazing
"He Gave Us a Recipe For Potato Chip Dip."
A remarkable classic!
True adaptation
Dream Much, Will?
Michael Mann is my hero
Better looking than the Limited Edition's Directors Cut
The first, arguably the best
Terrible Rendition of a Great Movie
Terrific stylistic thriller
Smell Yourself
Under-rated.
The original is still the best
An Effective Thriller.
GENTLEMAN FROM KRAKOW MAY BE RIGHT
Better than  *Silence of the Lambs* . . .
Lock the doors, pull the drapes...
A comment on commentary...
Forget the rest, this one's the best!
Stylish And Well-Assembled.
Finally, The Original Theatrical Release!
Manhunter LE
"Time is Love."
Manhunter
The best film with Hannibal in it
Manhunter: Michael Mann
Manhunter remains memorable
Smell Yourself....!
An 80's Time Machine
Meet the Real Hannibal Lecter
This film has a brain behind it unlikeThe Silence of the Lam
The inefabble human intolerance!
Is that all!?!
a double feature
Powerful moments inside sloppy script
explosive and extrodinary
An appalling waste of talent.
Big artists, mediocre work
its' alright
a very confused theme
Oh, Mr. Hopkins, we'll never have enough of you...
This movie BLOWS!
I really tried
The Human Stain
This dvd is defective!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
POIGNANT THEME, GREAT ACTING, COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENT
Phillip Roth's Final Trilogy Tale Comes To Life On Screen
The Heartbreaking Chaos Of The Human Condition
An odd way to tell a story about racial prejudice...
Good movie (if you're expecting a mediocre one.)
A Moral Stupidity
A Brilliant Film That Stands On Its Own Merits
The intransigence of comfort
Engrossing, but...
Strangely intriguing.
of course, it doesn't stand up to the novel
Interesting plot-driven character study
Underrated and Powerful
Amazingly bad
Mixed bag or results, but interesting and good!!
Love in winter
Having Read the Book I wanted to Satisfy My Curiosity About the Transfer to Film
Great drama, but not a suspense.
Slightly Flawed Film Boosted By High Star Power
Intriguing and complex but uneven and miscast
Too much star power for this quiet movie.
Wonderful film
uneven though interesting film
2 Hours of My Life Wasted
"How far would you go to escape the past?"
AN IMPORTANT FILM, WORTH REPEATED VIEWINGS
Disconnected
Theme and performances: Excellent. Movie: Less so
Outstanding performances, odd storytelling NO SPOILERS
No Oscar nominations?
Intriguing Theme That Needs More Careful Casting
A Powerful and Masterfully Done Movie
Must See!!
Leave the "Love Story" out.
Watch for the flashbacks, not the present
Just a touch draggy...and a bit too vulgar for my taste
A special though tragic film
Human stain...
Phenomenal
Peak performances
Very  enjoyable film
Close to the bone
Compelling in flashbacks
Outstanding!!
To Escape One's Past.
Flawed but Interesting
No, No, No!
Excellent adaptation of a great writer
Intriguing but disjointed
knowing who you are
One of the Greatest Dramas on Film
Revives memories if you&#65533;ve read the book; otherwise, beware
Great movie! Very original
A Beautiful, Haunting Tragedy
great cast, fantastic acting, subtle but effective story telling
Good Movie
Great performances
Worth a Rental
Effective novel adaptation
The Human Stain
An Unraveling Life...
Stained in the blood of a whole lifetime...
recommended only for to fans of character dramas
Moves you along
Even More Intimate on DVD
Yes, It's A Stretch, But Very Thought-Provoking & Fascinating
Could have been better
The old goat
Too good to have been an American hit in the theatres.
Too many ideas, cluttered but worthwhile
Like celery you have to have an aquired taste for this ...
Morality Play
Well acted, but less than the sum of its parts
Read the book instead
What's the range of your sense of tragedy?
This Movies Illustrates the Stain on American Society
Terrific
See This Film For Ed Harris' Performance
A Strained Stain
5 Human Stain Hopkinisms
Totally engrossing film !!!!!!!!!!

Hilarious movie finally on dvd, but. . .

Blood and Guts from an old Enemy
Memorable Film
Adolescent period piece is fun to watch
Great movie; Acceptable video quality
A classic movie with some talented but inexperianced stars
It should be shown every year to every High School student in America
Historically dated, but worth seeing
WOLVERINES !!
A somewhat corny yet strangely entertaining movie.
What If?
Good Action Movie
Great DVD
A Very Good Anti-War Movie
Best movie of the '80s, if you grew up in my neighborhood.
I wonder if some people even watched this movie...
Brutal, Realistic, Shocking, but one Hell of a way to Deliver a Message
Some of these reviewers need to watch the movie again!
A Snapshot of 80's Paranoia and Patriotism!!
Some people will say anything.
Great Movie - Bad DVD
enjoyable mind candy
This is one of the best war movies ever!
The best  PG-13 movie ever made
It was what it was
possible? unlikely.  Probable?  sure!

Yes, I have to Admit ...
Red Dawn- Don't ever say "It can't happen here"...
Dumb editorial review
3 stars + one or two extra to PO the oneswho give it 1
From Our Cold Dead Hands
A classic Cold War movie that still packs a punch!
An Interesting 80s Movie
A Genuine Film Classic!
A Favorite of a &quot;Left-Wing Wacko&quot;
Interesting movie that reflects its era
An Excellent War Movie
It's a dated film, but don't be scared, it's just a movie.
Average Teens become Super Ninja's of Death!!!
Paranoid view of the world, but great entertainment
Good movie: bad presentation on DVD

"Only the dead have seen the end of war."  -Plato
Impossible, but a healthy role reversal
Of Course It's a Dumb Idea ...
An extremely disappointing DVD release
What is with political view reviews?
Why do some people always "date" their movies?
Classic Cold War Thriller still packs an explosive punch!
Why all the outrage?
completely over the head of both liberals and nationalists
How soon we forget
Purposely Misunderstood
Movie with Biggest Influence on me during my Childhood
America under attack
A Materpeice. . .
If you love government, you'll not like this movie

Very fun and animated!
Looks good but there are so many "ugh" moments
Misty Island perhaps worst Thomas movie to date
Suspense, Thriller....Kids Version!
Very poorly developed
Nothing but a Commercial, just in time for Christmas!
Super-annoying movie that children LOVE
The ONLY thing that can keep my 2-year-old quiet for a good 50-minutes
Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue
It was a hit!
Ok for Thomas Fans
My 3 y/o and 5 y/o sons loved it.
Too scary for my 3 year old
Don't do it!! It's not the same Thomas
Scary Scene, Silly New Characters, Catchy Song, Animated Faces -- Just OK
Will Gladly Add To Our Thomas Collection
Awful

Pretty interesting movie
Fun, adventuresome, good drama
Super 8
Super 8 Rates a 10
This film really feels like summer
Goonies Meets E.T at District 9.
Fun (and some good scary parts!)
Fun movie to watch
Super 8 movie
Interesting, but does not compare to the beloved  "E.T."
I wanted this to be super...
Could have been better
Well made and entertaining
Not your traditional E.T.
Alien meets E.T.
E.T. meets Aliens, all served up with Speilberg style.
Great movie
Great Summer Movie
Great Movie
E.T.'s Buff Cousin Fights His Way Home
Pretty Good Timewaster
Never a dull moment
Good Family Movie!
Fun, entertaining movie
Yes its like ET or Goonies, but thats why its 5 stars
I completely identified with these young characters...
Sublime -- and none of that UltrViolet crap :)
old school epic
Elle Fanning in Super 8
Enjoyed it
loved it!!!!!
Great Fun
Unexpected pleasures
Great movie
Snapshot of An Era
ALIEN GO HOME
JJ Abrams' inspired take on childhood
The most overrated movie of the decade!
JJ Abrams is no Steven Spielberg
Entertaining, engrossing and extra-terrestrial - Derivative but from the very best
1 of the Best films I've seen in 2011 - 5 Stars for both movie and blu-ray transfer
This movie is "Mint!"
Great Fun!
Genuinely Entertaining
'Super 8' is an excellent homage to Spielberg!
Fantastic Movie
Not so like goonies & ET as people are saying
Super 8 Made Me A Kid Again
Spielberg-esque
A Solidly Crafted Blockbuster For 2011
Collision Between "The Goonies" and "The War of the Worlds", with "E.T." as an afterthought,
SUPER 8 - A masterful original story, with omage to Spielbergian Cinema.
Pure excitement!
A well-rounded sci-fi thriller
light entertainment
Super 8 certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it
E.T.'s Crystal Skull of the 3rd Kind
Disappointing
Entertaining -- very derivative of ET and other Spielberg films
Works too hard to be Spielbergesque
An entertaining film
Bad Things Happen to Good People
Lens flares for all!
Spielberg film history, all in one place...
Diverting summer fun
Mostly mint
Starts good, then gets really predictable
OK movie to watch
Only good if you like Speilberg's work
Worth Watching
Decent "Family" movie but not for the hardcore fans of scifi
Super 8 Blunder
Feels like Spielberg and Stephen King
Not at all what I was expecting
a good rental, no need to watch it again.
Super 8 = Super Great!
It's Like THE GOONIES crossed with E.T. with a touch of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND
Liked it
Quintessential Summer Movie!  GREAT!
Good Movie - Definitley worth renting
3.5 more than a 3 but Derivative of ET and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
super 8
Entertaing, okay movie
Expected greatness, and I got it.
Fun!
The Spielberg Replication is a Success
in my book- Aces
Streaming: beware the 43:00 mark!
Awesome
A movie about relationships.
"Production value!!"
Stand By Me/It/Dreamcatcher/ET/Goonies
Fantastic... Right up until the end
Super Nostalgia for Blockbusters Like This One
Excellent for Curing Insomnia
Worth watching once but so far I'm not A fan off JJ Abrams movies
It's All About The Storytelling
A rollercoaster which makes you jump out of your seat
Abrams is "Super"
"Super 8" is brilliant!
weak
How did two great directors create such a lame movie?
Good but not great
Not what I expected
"Super 8" is a new, modern masterpiece.  A bluray review.
Great Film!!
Typical Spielberg
great acting & production, but still a patchwork quilt of cliched plot elements
Missing some logic
First hour was great, then it seemed I was watching ET.
I enjoyed this movie!!! Exciting and Action Packed.
Great Movie
Simple but Great
What the Summer Blockbuster Should Aspire to Be
Train wreck of a movie
Did We See The Same Movie
WOW!!! what a great movie!
I couldn't wait for this steaming pile to end.
Non Stop Entertainment.
Awesome movie
Ups and Downs
Interesting movie - worth watching
Abrams and Spielberg made a great summer blockbuster!
I wanted to love this movie, and I almost did.
MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE
Super 8 (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)

Loved it!
George in Virginia

Rude awakening!!!
Fun Film!
A Cute Spielberg Film By A More Modern Writer/Director
For The Kids In Us All
Goonies of  2011
Homeward Bound
Wonderful 80's movie
Big Blu Ray Sound
Enjoyable movie, but kind of falls a bit flat. (potential SPOILERS)
Collage of E.T., Close Encounters and other such stuff
50% "wow!" and 50% "uh, where's the rest of the movie?"
Old School Story Telling
Like cloverfield with kids..
lame
ET meets the Goonies haha
A SUPER Movie!
Love the Goonies? Then you will love this!
Super 8 - Delightfully Expected
Not Without My Mother
Amazing!
Great Movie!!!
I ate up Super 8
THE Summer action movie of 2011
Created By Brilliant Talent
Good but not that good
It's NOT "The Goonies"
Entertaining at first, but disappoints in the end.
derivative and disappointing
Super 8 Blu-Ray
A New Classic Summer Film, and one of best of 2011.
nice movie
Awesome Movie
Awesome Movie
Feels like a Classic
Super 8
great little movie
1/2 and 1/2
Beautiful, nostalgic film
Great movie!
Thin line between homage and derivative . . . SUPER-8 goes both ways
Bad reviews miss the point, and the heart, of this film
Thank God for you Speilberg
Best film of 2011
Fantastic
Fun, well written movie
Don't get it.
just a warning
Good Sci-Fi
Falls terribly short
8 Was Enough for Me
release the alien
once was enough
Four plus two divided by two equals three.
Super Deal
Flashback...
Can't believe I paid to watch this!
A very good sci/fi thriller that fans of Cloverfield will love. Could have been a little shorter and been better though. I say B
Super Aliens
Terrific Story with Wonderful Acting
Disappointing
"Goonies" meets "Iron Giant"
Intersting Science Fiction Movie
JJ Abrams 'phones home' a winner
Disappointed
Very quick delivery and good movie also.
Great movie!
good movie fo' sho....
Best of the recent Sci-Fi films I've taken a chance with - Blu Ray
Does anyone feel sorry for all of those dumb aliens...
Genre of its own
Very Disapointed
Lukewarm
GREAT MOVIE!
ok movie, but horrible sound mix.
Super 8 (Two-disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo + Digital copy)
super 8. epic
another cheesey si-fi movie
STOLZ
One of the best movies ever!
slow action & 90% of the movie was too dark...??
J.J. Abrams's love letter to Generation X, Spielberg, and Debbie Harry
slowwwwww
Fun Movie
Very Disapointing
Good Movie
Disappointing
Fun but ...
Didn't have the "magic" I expected
IT WAS JUST OK FLICK .. BUT FORGETABEL AFTER SHORT WHILE!!
Good movie, big BUT...
Movie made for kids and then the rest...
Gawd awful
Insipid.
Really a teen movie...
Warmed Over Spielberg for Kids
Cloverfield meets The Goonies
LOST Goonies
so so
Super 8 = Super sweet and Super Scary Fun
Made me love going to the movies again!
Waste
Slow
Watch other movies - not Super 8
E.T. Meets Cloverfield!!!
Good as the hype?
Super8
traditional Speilberg fare
Absolute total disappointment (some "spoilers")
Mediocre 8
NOT Speilberg's best work at all!!
Beautiful and stirring, but surprisingly mechanical and eventually empty....
Has its moments, but ultimately feels like a letdown.
Let's make a hit, says JJ Abrams. So much for making a good movie.
One of the best of 2011!
SUPER 8
If you are a Gen X'er, you should like this movie
Coke, Popcorn, and a Classic Movie
Perfect!
Super 8
Super 8 is SUPER
Great movie
Kicking myself for not seeing it in theaters
"SUPER 8" IS A SUPER ENTERTAINING FLICK!!!
one more for "BORING"!
Sort of ET meets Close Encounters meets ALIEN
Super BAD
A boring re-make of E.T., wasted my time and money.
Dull
Not a "feel good" movie
the best movie in the whole world!!!!!!!!!
Good movie for mental midgets and children
Super 8 rental
Not ET
Intellectual Pablum
Too Borrowed
Goonies vs the Broken-Hearted Cannibal Alien
I never feel compelled to write a review, but...
think Cloverfield
Horrible movie, filled with so many plot holes you could drive a train through it!
Boring
Take away the hype, it's just an OK movie
Another garbage release to empty the wallets of the masses.
One of the worst movies
OK MOVIE...ANNOYING KIDS
Modernized Love Letter to 80s Adventure Flicks is Sometimes Too Indulgent
Alien meets Close Encounters, and definitely disappoints...
Not as fresh as I hoped
Extremely overrated
Tries hard to recapture an era, but just feels derivative
huge disapointment
Super 8 out of focus
WHICH AUDIENCE WAS THIS FILM MADE FOR?
Ok movie with a lose plot
This Movie Doesn't Know What It Wants to Be
Nothing new.........but it's entertaining.
What was that?
Horrible movie & way too dark
Just didn't do it for me
BORING!!!!!
Play it for ten minutes then turn it off.
Expected more from JJ Abrams
ET  Blows it
I've seen this before
It was awful
Aliens.... Really
The kids are annoying and worthless
Train wreck????
worst movie
Had high hopes for this but very disappointed
Missed the greater story for a losing scenario of science fiction
Still Has not Shipped
Terrible
boring and offensive
Boring!!!!
Spielberg clone wins no points for bashing US military and scientific communities
Not E.T., Not Alien, NOT X-Men, Not Jaws, Not the Blob, Not the Goonies
"AUTO-PILOTISH DIRECTION"
How do you get past the original premise?
Sucks save your 3.99
STR8 TRASH! WAT A HEIST!
Christina
super 8
So So Movie With A Dumb Ending
Can only be described as Amazingly.......
7.1 audio track cuts out
So much potential!
i felt raped watching this trash
Boring story that's full of cursing kids!
Bad, bad, bad!
Super 8 - Disappointed
Too Vague, Too Forced
Super 8
A great movie for kids?  Really?
Stupid 8
One of the worst films of 2011
MAD
Super "0"!
Must Balance Out the Retards...
Only Trash
Super 8
I hate these kids
A Classic Spielberg Sci-Fi Romp
All the right ingredients, but not memorable
May not be suitable for younger audiences
I Liked It!
Goonies, E.T., and Cloverfield
SOMEWHAT GOOD BUT I EXPECTED MORE
Charming.
Some fine performances
You'll never want it to end...
Enjoyed every riveting minute
Now this is how fun movies should be!
Super 8 brings back magical moviemaking
I Didn't H8 It, But It Wasn't Gr8

A True Gem For The Horror Genre
decent but weak ending
Unique Horror Movie that Will Keep You Entertained
Strange movie but very good
Do you like to be shocked?
LIKE IT MORE SO THAN THE FIRST
WEIRD ENDING
And A Little Child Shall Lead Them..
A Bloody Psychodrama---VERY PSYCHO!
Well-conceived and a welcome genre slasher!
A Horror Story with Some Heart to It.
A Psychological Slasher?
Wow. Not for the Timid.
Not My Bag... and Malevolence?  No Warning that this was a Prequel.
A thrilling movie, the prequel to Malevolence!
Strong Beginning, Predictable Weak Ending
Disturbingly Wicked!
Sick? A shocking ending? Incredibly guresome? I guess standards are low these days...
An excellent psychological study of madness and the passing of madness to another person
Scary, fresh and original......well almost.....
Banal and Unscary
Solid Serial Killer Movie With Better Ideas than Execution

Nice grusome movie with cleavage

Think Slice & Dice With A Dab Of Psychological Thriller
Graham Sutter: "You don't feel ANYthing do you? Guilt, pain, regret... NOTHING! DO you? Who are YOU to judge ME?"
Genuine display of talent
Had Potential and Was Better Than Expected, But ....
Bereavement
Women as Victims
Disappointing
Slice and Dice Rationale
Hack, Slash, Snore....
Nature vs. nurture...with a dungeon and bloody knives
This is one sick movie
If you like boring scary movies...
"If they can't feel, then they have no fear..."
Not a horror gem
Not Your Normal Horror Movie
Couldn't Watch It
Small story: B-Horror
great scary film
A Disappointing Pre-quel
OK, but nothing spectacular
Nothing new or shocking
Great prequel.
A Cut Below Malevolence, But Still Worthwhile
PRETTY GOOD STORY  A BIT GORY & TWISTED !!!
Poor story
Good slasher flick
A Plot Hole Mess of Torture Porn
Dull, not much gore, uninteresting story
2 Stories Join to Become 1 Haunting Tale
The Making of a Serial Killer.  (A Serial Killer May Be Living Around the Corner from You!)
"If They Have No Feelings, Then They Can't Know Fear."...
Overwhelmingly superior horror/tragedy [SPOILERS]

DARK JOURNEY
Serial Killer Growth
Slightly better than most in the genre

Silly and Stupid
Too zany to be funny but is Hilarious nonetheless
No Honor Among Thieves (But Some Laughs, Apparently)
Amazing

Funny film-POOR 1ST DVD PACKAGE THOUGH
Brit American Style.

Quite simply the best comedy film in decades.
Floppy bit of a fish...
Don`t Call This Fish a Classic
Not Quite Like I Remembered It!  Ages Very, Very Poorly!  Bad DVD Too!

A Fish Called Wanda
A smashing comedy
Superb Movie, great edition
3.5 stars out of 4
John Cleese brilliantly displays his comedic genius again!
Mean-spirited, Crude, Vulgar, and Unkind to Animals
Smart Funny Flick
*amused*
A Great Anglo-American Comedy
Gets funnier the more times you watch it
A real cult movie in its genre!
Fun to watch
Utilization Of A Vivid Background Does Not Help A Scenario Having Flawed Logic.
A Decent Rental & Nothing More
Decent overall BD for hardcore MMA fans
Fun movie, bad acting
moving but controversial film
Charming with a social message
Intense, funny, crazy - story of modern Israel
A Rarity!
Charming & engaging
wonderful
James is no frayer...
a funny poigant satiric slice of life film set in Israel
Real Life in Israel
Should have been better
Not widescreen,not as advertised!
Great movies, Great value
A mixed bag
Double Trouble
Head to head between 2 women
WHY DID W. FAIL?
More than meets the eye....
Stone Rushed The Film At The Expense of Insight
Josh Brolin's pitch perfect as George W.
Not a Bush bashing film
Macro-accurate
A must see!
3.5 Stars--Very well acted, but the film feels incomplete.
Suprisingly dull
The Life of W
Very Good
W... the movie
Resemblances are uncanny
Behind the scenes and then some.... "W" Rules!!!
worth seeing
Not The Hatchet Job You Were Expecting
solid film, makes you feel sorry for George W. Bush
Fascinating and tragic character study of a non-reflective man
Stone makes good films, truthful or not...
W Redux.....look again!
Josh Brolin Does Great -
From a life of let-downs to a life of Presidency
like it or not, he was our president for 8 years....
In other news, Oliver Stone is still an axe-grinding hack.
Oliver Stone's Best Film In Years
Brilliant Portrayal of The Former Presisdent.
W the movie
W.
W...I.S...G.O.O.D...
It's Better Than What You've Been Led To Believe
Skeptical
Interesting Profile of a President
Brolin scores a bull's-eye
Surprisingly well-balanced, even sympathetic
The Real "W"
W. and The Two Theories.
Unflattering but not Unsympathetic Study of George W. Bush's Slow Rise and Rapid Fall.
Remember Billy Carter?  How about Roger Clinton?
When will it ever end?
Very good movie gets pretty good Blu-Ray
Thoroughly Suprised...
W. Pulled no punches but was sympathetic
W: You Did a Helluva a Job
So-so movie; poor disk
Brilliantly Done!
what happens when a muddle-minded mediocre man becomes president?
Shallow
E for Effort
What is this?Faction? What a mess.
Like a Greek Tragedy.
A realistic portray with wider implications!
What Went Wrong With "W"?
A Project that Misfired
regardless, its an interesting film
Caricatures and cliches
Innacurate
Curve ball for liberals
"Is our children educated or just . . . misunderestimated?"
A Film That Will Gain Respect In Time
Cute parody of a man who may have been a great president
W a disappointment
Disappointing....
A vain little man
Excellent!
The real reason there are so many bad reviews here is. .  .
Too early
how the mighy have fallen......not Bush....Stone.
Worse than expected given the source material
Interesting documentary
Good acting saves this otherwise arrogantly shallow movie
BEST MOVIE OF 2008!
Boring
W = BS
UH NOT EXACTLY SUBTLE, OLIVER
"W" Stands For "Why?"
To understand this movie, you need to understand Oliver Stone
"W." is brilliant!
Am I missing something?? Did the above 2-star reviewers actually see this movie???
If you have no opinions and no brain join the Bush hating Fan Club
W the movie
Unless you like dull movies about bad presidents...
Thinly Disgiused Neo-Con Propaganda
Plain and boring film for a plain and boring man?
Not worth the time......
W. didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.
Waste of my time
stunningly bad
oliver stone's view of the president
'W' as in Weak movie about a Weak man
Please Oliver,  a little honesty would be nice!
SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
WALKER?  CALIGULA??????????????????????????
typical Oliver Stone
"W" is a sham to Geo. Bush
Gee, Oliver Stone, Do You Think You Could Have Embellished This Film Any More?
Pitiful!!!
W
Stone: 60's stoner liberal with a SNL sense of production/direction
Psychology Rather Than Politics
Far from good
What Place Do You Think He Will Have in History?
Not the movie you'd expect from Oliver Stone...but still a very well-done film
Everybody loves Jeb
The Frat Nazis On Top  ( * * *  1/2 )
A Bit Disappointing
Sub-par at best
A misunderestimated film
Easy transaction...creepy movie.
Recommended Only for Political Junkies Who Like Talking Heads
The Dubya disaster
W. - Blu-ray Info
WARNING!!
Huh?
Some good performances, but horrible!
Unbox not always Reliable
Boring Another Stone Distortion of Histroy
Wendy rates "W"
As if there is not already enough of this crap in the news
Disgusting
One star for the heck of it and to annoy BDS patients
Portrait Of A Bumbler
"Who do you think you are?  A Kennedy?"
Stone proves his irrelevance
George W. Bush: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me... and won't get fooled again."
Ok
Silly and corny
Not to interesting
Like "The Doors"
Excellent Portrayal
Just How "W." Was No JFK Or Nixon, Neither Is His Oliver Stone Film.
Good potential that goes unrealized
"I'll never get out of Papa's shadow!"
Shrugworthy
"W"orthwhile......grab some pretzels and enjoy!!!!!
Transparently partisan, occasionally entertaining
A 1 Dimensional Man Not Fit for the Presidency
Operates Under The "Bush Is An Idiot" Pretense, But Still A Possible Scenario
Oh puhleeeze, Mr/Ms Amazon Snifter, a second chance! I was duhrunk when I wrote it . . .
A weird journey..
Abysmal movie both directing and content or lack thereof)
Not as Biased As Expected... Not as Great Either
Life of W
Is "W" for WMD or for War?
About as subtle a movie one could ever make about The Decider.
Brilliant depiction of history's most dangerously mediocre man
Pointing at others
Not worth watching unless you were in a coma during the presidency
Stone goes easy...
'W.' Review
Love Nixon, not W.
Presidential portrait of George W. Bush
"I can handle things! I'm smart! Not like everybody says - like dumb!  I'm smart!"
Oedipus Tex
Political Cartoon
Devolves into Caricature
Lukewarm Oliver Stone
The Title Is Pronounced Dubbya -- Yeah, That Guy
Not too bad!
well done for what it was
Just for the history
Fairly Accurate (Albeit Too Cautious) Portrayal of Political Banality & Wickedness of the G.W. Bush/Dick Cheney Administration
Yikes! Actors chosen for their looks... not on acting ability
Some Historical Inaccuracies, But Still, Rather Well Told
W. Worth a look.
W
3.5 stars -- a thoughtful film but frustratingly incomplete
Another average movie from Stone
Where's the hook...?
Good portayal of Bush and ....the administration
It is Just me or did this remind anyone else of Forrest Gump
Interesting biopic
People and fish can coexist!!!
Bush jr according to Stone
Disappointing if only because expectations were so high
Bush + Oliver Stone minus Controversy = ???
Revealing
The Man Who Wasn't There
A closer look at the most hated man in the world...
Stone looks back...and to the Right
could've been better, but more than worth a rental
Josh Brolin got the Oscar nom for the wrong movie
Excellent, and sadly misunderstood
"George, stay out of the barrel.  Just trust me."
Half Clown, Half Crusader
"Fool me once...umm...shame on you...you ain't gonna fool me again"
Excelent
Very Long
What do we know and when did we know it...
New view of Bush
Watched It Twice And Liked It Even Better The Second Time
W
Hands Down, My Favorite Stone Movie!!!!
Amazing film!
Great Movie
Misunderestimated No More
BRILLIANT CHARACTER STUDY OF FATHER AND SON.
Daddy, Please be Proud of Me
A Stone's Throw Above a Three

DOGMA DVD REVIEW: Good movie, no extras (Boo!)
The best movie of 1999 (after Being John Malkovich)
Thumbs up for Dogma
The best comedy of 1999
EVOLUTION IS EVEN AFFECTING CHRISTIANITY!
Kevin Smith is a witty man
Dogma
"B+" idea with "C-" execution
The best film on religion made in the last 10 years
Great Movie, but where's the Collector DVD?
"I Do Believe In This"
Smith's 4th outhing
Like A Senior Thesis
Its Just a Movie (Although a Really Funny One)!!
Fun movie despite lots of foul language
Dogma Rules
In my top 5 movies ever
This is my favorite movie
Great elements just don't quite mesh in the end
Dogma Rules!
Hilariously funny look at religion
The Lapsed Catholic movie
awesome
One of my favorite movies in my collection
Great Movie Great Price
Weird but Good
good movie
Ah, I remember this one.

Bizarre, but good
Awsome
Great Kevin Smith film
BUDDY JESUS!
Brilliant, hillarious and thought provoking
Catholicism....WOW!
A humorous look at faith
Good but....
Good but....
Why can't  they teach this in Sunday school?
The best of The NJ Five
You won't believe how good this film is..
DOGMA
Dogma has new ideas about religion
No Shortcuts Into Heaven
Kevin Smith, No Kubric/Stone/Scorcese/ but still cool.
Good ideas... but flawed in execution
The Best Film Of 99'
All this with Jay and Silent Bob, too.
A very funny movie with a so so ending
One of the best comedies in some time
Good but not Kevin Smith-ish....
I LOVE this movie!!
Can't yet give it 5 stars, but 4 on the film itself!
Hilarity and religion; what an odd couple
DOGMA is Dynomite!
If you like Kevin Smith you'll enjoy Dogma
Kevin Smith is my hero....
Accessible, Controversial, Immaculate
Dogma Rocks!
everyone thinks they are a movie critic!
Smith does it again!
And God said Ha!
Smith's Crisp but not a hot potato
Surprisingly Thought Provoking
A very gentle satire
Great movie, weak DVD -- wait for the next release
whelmed - over !
Incredibly Well-Layered Film
Smith Gets To Tackle Religion And Keeps A Tight Knit Plot
Jay and silent Bob Messangers from her holyness God
Metatron makes this film.
Wonderful
A Supernatural Hit!
Just get the regular Dogma DVD
Worth watching, but not his best
Ripe Material for Satire is Often Too Quirky and Scripted
Here's The Deal...
Awesome classic Ben and Damon.
Hillarious
I repeat, this is not a drill. This is the apocalypse. Please exit the hospital in an orderly fashion. Thank you
looks great on Bluray
Interesting Point of View
A great film...Kevin Smith does it again!
Dogma scores big
Kevin Smith's Masterpiece
Great Satire
Some guys didn't get the spirit.
Every Catholic's Worst Nightmare!
Star Studded - Silent Bob Steals the Show

DOGM,A
Not only Kevin Smith's best - but an excellent overall movie
Kevin Smith does it again
A Film of Extremely Mixed Blessings.
one of the strangest vanity films ever made
Snoogans
The downward spiral that is Kevin Smith
God bless Kevin Smith
The best bad movie I ever saw...
Deeply, Cynically Funny
So good!
Hilarious, but...
Dogma is a movie with real ups &amp; downs
another kevin smith masterpiece
The most hilarious movie I've ever seen.
the funiest movie ever
Kevin Smith takes on God in outlandish satire
Better: Clerks, Amy
Who's house? Ron's house!!
Watch with an open mind
A different twist to religion.
Not a movie for the overly serious people of the world.
Kevin Smith's best
An examination of faith
Kevin Smith Rules!
Smith's DOGMA is a Hellva of Good Time
Brilliant
Dogma
Jay and Silent Bob at their best!
Why Smith is A Great Writer of our Generation...
Smith Hits One Home With A little Satire
Dogma in Blu-ray
Just to make clear, it's a four star movie though all the lousy one star reviews needed to be counter balanced
Intriguing Disappointment...Must be Kevin Smith
Dogma Easter eggs -- nooch! :)
I AM religious & I loved it!
Good DVD, okay film.
Kevin Smith does it again
Alanis Morsette... god???
A solid movie.  Flawed as hell, but solid.
Some pretty cool extras one major glitch
Excellent Movie
Just Plain Great.
Best religious comedy since Life Of Brian.
Great!
Kevin Smith does it again!
Not as bad as everyone said!
The Wizard of Oz meets the Pope
I found the movie cute &amp; amusing!
GOD, this is such a good movie.
Good movie. Not great, but definitely enjoyable
Dogma
Fantastic!
A Very Clever Film
It's the dialogue stupid.
This is a fun movie that makes me think.
Great film!
Kevin Smith Does it again
Great Portrail of God
Holy Bartender!
The most original and halarious film of the year
dogma
Too many useless features
Better than the Television version on Comedy Central!
Some great fun to watch!
"No Wonder He Says He Saw Jesus, Hommie's Rockin The Ganja!"
It's nice to laugh at our religion
Guaranteed to make you laugh.
Edgy, Sharp and Fun
Many a true word has been said in a joke
Silly movie poking fun at Kevin's Catholic past
don't get mixed up
It's Dogma, need I say more.
A great film for people who think
Outrageously funny
Another smart Kevin Smith flick...
"Even God has a sense of humor"
with extras that i actually enjoyed
Hard topics in 10 seconds
Funny
Great Movie, Excellent Satire and Wit
Witty
Irreverent fun
Hot Dogma
Smith tackles religion thoughtfully?  Well, Dogma cats!
DVDeity calls, and Smith answers the bell
One of our favorites
Dogma Delivers
Top Notch DVD
ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS
Good effort, but flawed, don't expect a masterpiece
God, this is one hell of a flick!
A Solid Improvement on an Excellent Original
JAY is not funny!!
Great Film
Mr. Smith&#65533;s Best Effort to Date
funny
Brilliant, bloody brilliant
Snoogans!
Kevin Smith is a god on earth...
grate movie
Move over Clerks, Mallrats, & Chasing Amy, Dogma's in town!
Dogma is Brilliant
An Entertaining Diversion, Not Much More
dogma is cosmic law.
Kevin Smith
FUNNY! HILARIOUS! GREAT ACTORS AND MANY MANY EXTRAS!
Extremely Funny
Great Plot-Dirty Talk
Dog..............ma
We couldn't wait for the special edition??
Gory satire
Anything from Kevin Smith ROCKS!!!
awsome!
DVD receipt
DVD Dogma
God Is A Woman, Amen!
BOLDLY CYNICAL (AND OCCASIONALLY FUNNY) LOCKER-ROOM PRATTLE
DOGMA CATCHES THE WORLDS EYE IN RELIGION
Not Kevin Smith's best, but very close.
veiw askew rules
THIS MOVIE IS REALLY FUNNY!!!
Hilarious look at the view of Catholic religion!
The most solid and thought out KS movie I've seen!
A great movie that isn't afraid to tweak noses...
Another example of a top notch DVD
Rather surprising flick...
Tells the truth about religion
Biting Satire at it's finest
Nice Try
Catholic review
Cutting-Edge Theology in a Pop-Culture Package
BORNING
A HILLARIOUS FILM ABOUT RELIGION
Kevin Smith's satire on religion,good vs evil,and christ
Wreckless Abandon - It's a long way from Clerks
Not Kevin Smith's finest hour
This movie rocks
DogMAA will you buy me this DVD for my birthday?
You can't include Jay & Silent Bob and not expect comparison
A student film run amuck
Catholicism HUH?
Not that good
the most WORDY movie I've ever seen!
Not enough Janeane
Kevin Smith is the greatest
Kick A$$
"Does that mean the last Zion is part black?"
Make a good Confession
Catholics Parents: This is a must see movie (no joking)
What if religion had survived to the 20th century? And changed somehow?
Wry take on religion.
Dogma DVD
The worst movie ever?
Why can't anybody get an attack on religious doctrine right?
God-awful
ponderous and puerile
A BAD JOKE
Dogma a Dog
A Bad Joke
One of the Worse!!
completely missed the mark
Dogma
I Walked Out of the Theater and I'm Protestant
DOGMA: A Preview of Hell
immature take on Christianity
Oh,Please
PRETENTIOUS AND IRRITATING
Awesome
ryan hickneys dogma review
Do your self a favor, stay away!!!
Dog vomit
HORRIBLE
Wake me up when it's over.
what a stupid movie
DOGMA?  more like DOG$#!@
Existence for dummies....
Holy crap, batman
This is Serious Religious Satire? (DOGMA)
Pass this one by.
What a horrible movie
I hate this movie more than life itself
Don't waste your time... BORING and ANNOYING
sacrilegious and funny
Brilliant
Definitely for twentysomethings.
Steer clear of this clunker
Dogma is a dog.
Why the critics hate this show...
What a Dud!
TERRIBLE MOVIE
Pretentious Pseudo-intellectualism
Dogma blends humor with thought
Sloppy, self-important, and, ultimately, dull and dumb.
All hail the King of dvds (God, this is good)
Why did I wait so long to see this movie?
One of the best movies EVER!
Yea Kevin Smith!
Dogma at it's best!
"God? Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor."
great movie for the open minded.
Theologically Sound!
A Must Have For Kevin Smith Fans
Orignal and Dazzling!
A more balanced and thought out review than my last one.....
Dogma is a pure pleasure to see over and over again
Faith May Be A Funny Thing, but DOGMA is Hilarious!!!
I'd really give it 4  1/2 (it's great, but can't top Clerks)
Non-linear Story Telling at its Best
Wonderful Introduction to Gould's Work for Students
Not a documentary; not meant to be.
The film won awards because it should've.
Great!
A film more than a documentary
Long-time favorite
Quirky, challenging, rewarding film
VHS Replacement
Beautiful film
When will this film be reissued on DVD?
A different kind of biopic: the Gould variations
A fascinating impression of a great and unusual man.
An introduction into the Mind of Gould.
Clever!
Glen Gould Rocks You
GREAT,GREAT,GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!
Saw enough
Thank God It Isn't PG-13!!!
Sick, twisted, and awesome
"Saw" Cuts, But Not Deep Enough
ending could have been alot better
Best of the series
This movie is for retards.
A Rare Breed Of Movie
Saw It and Liked It
Maybe I just missed something in the translation...
a disappointment
If this is what passes for great horror these days...
Taut, tense, fresh entry into a tired genre
How much blood would you shed to stay alive?
"I Sawed The Best Minds Of My Generation"
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
Disgusting, Disturbing And Sick!... But Pretty Good.
Cut and paste
Saw
Extremely brutal - Seven is Sesame Street compared to this
Isn't it funny....
Bad Acting and Excessive Gore Weighs down intriguing premise
good but not great
Very Disappointed
"Are you going to watch yourself die tonight?"
I  SAW  SAW
This movie has the best ending ever in a horror flick.
What was cut...?
Interesting cerebral horror flick..... *** 1/2
Modern Horror Classic!
A unique and very intriguing horror flick: ****1/2
A flawed, but intensely scary piece of horror
Gory, violent, suspenseful, and an ending that ruins it
This movie you have to get..........Now
WAY Better than Expected!
Very good..........BUT....
Yet another lame attempt
BEST SUSPENCE MOVIE SINCE SEVEN!!
This movie is awesome...
A review of both the film and DVD edition
Package Problem
I want to play a game!
The SAW series
gross
SAW...to experience or enjoy, that's the question.
"Anyone Care To Play A Game?"
"I've Given Your Life a Purpose"
Bloody but good!
Saw 4 is a goo scary movie and a 4 star DVD
psychological delight
SAW
SAW
First in the series is an absolute must
2 stars out of 4
gave me the creeps
I believe them limbs are me
Bloody!
Cuts to the chase
Great horror movie, full of shocks & twists
A question
'induced nausea' as an artform!  inspired brilliance!
See SAW
GREAT
Caution!! you might have to think to understand this movie.
Question
Plenty of thrills and chills!
SHARP SAW
Are you grateful to be alive?
An Excellent Horror Flick
The beginning
nothing special
The "Jigsaw Killer" plays another bloody little game
The Beast is Disease, blood is merely a symptom
Believe the hype
A Horror Classic
very frustrating
Good Novelties and Surprises. Weak story. Mildly scary.
The Flaw of `Saw'
not for the light hearted
It Had Potential...It Really Did.
Grind
Great Movie, with a great twist
A Scary Thriller That's Loaded With Twists and Turns
Mind Blowing Thriller!
And the moral of the story is........
Saw
live or die!
Saw delivers the goods with a killer ending
definately in my 'Top 10'...
Saw gets the saw......a good premise but it doesnt add up
Better than most of what passes for horror
Great plot for a horror film
See Saw!
I was never one for movie reviews
Better as a Whole
great movie
one of the best horror movies ive seen
Ridiculous
Please...
I want you to make a choice...
gag me, kill me, do something to put me out of this misery
"SAW"s Other Horror Films To Pieces...
One Shock In The End Doesn't Cut It
Not since Resevoir Dogs...
A puzzle missing a few pieces
Certainly not as good as its made out to be
Had nightmares after
Saw...saw what?!  SEVEN wanna-be....
a rare film for me
cool case, decent movie, funny commentary
Saw
orignal was much better....
Why oh why does everyone pick on Cary Elwes?
lossy audio and mpeg2 -- pass on purchasing until a re-issue
Dark, gritty, disturbing, gruesome; takes the best of the genre and adds a nice little twist...originality...
THANK YOU JAMES WAN-YOU ARE CLEVER!
The Best Serial Killer Movie Since Silence of The Lambs.
Every puzzle has its pieces
A Collage of previously seen footage.
Let's Play a Game
saw uncut
Be careful...
Little Indie film that satisfies...
One of my Favorite Movies!
Scarriest horror film I've ever seen
Finally, a horror movie to write home about
'Saw' A Suprisingly Smart Horror Yarn...Uncut Even Better
Suspenseful
Saw
YES!! IT KICKS!! MAKES MY LIST!
Gory Goodness!
Saw  (2004)
An amazing psychological thriller!!
In the right direction...
A good movie
See "Saw"
I Saw.......
Saw WILL Mess With You!!!
Prepare For The Ride Of Your Life
[Hilarious Saw Pun]
Great Thriller!
careful, this movie may surprise you
Different from what I expected
A little something for the gore hound in you...
Eh...
It could have been better
Starts out more promising than it ends.
Good Story, Great Execution
Johnny boy has done it again, this time it's a scrubber
Keep you guessing till the very end...
A DAM GOOD HORROR FILM
the best movie released in 2004
One twisted ride!!!
Disappointed (2.5 Stars)
Saw...So Bad it Should Be in Detention...
I laughed out loud
Avoid
Great Movie, Horrible Picture Quality
A Missed Chance
A Short quiz to help you decide....
Such an INSANE MOVIE!!!!
Repent, or be Punished
Absolutely brilliant
Another "Grand daddy" is born
A Newer, Bolder, Inventive Franchise . . . .
Cool Idea
I was expecting a bigger saw
saw saw and like what i saw!
great ,bloody movie
I love fear on your face...
Entertaining but a little overrated...
original. just this one, though.
A good horror film with an interesting premise, but flawed nonetheless
Edge of your seat thriller
And This Was Only Their First Movie???
Looked good in the previews, anyway...
The "Jigsaw Killer" plays another bloody little game
Come on kids...
The most disappointing film of the year.
Saw I - Bloody breath of fresh air
Mind @%*%
Modern day thriller doesn't  compare with the classics..
An O.K. thriller, nothing great.
If You SAW It and Liked It, You SAW What You Wanted To
Great story concept!
Like Hitchcock On Crack
Twisted, wicked, dark, and fun.
This SAW has Teeth!  Bzzzzzzzzzz!
Nothing Special
good for Halloween, after that, loses its luster
The first true horror masterpiece of the 21st century
Horrifying doesn't even begin to describe it.
You Cannot Call This A Film, The Premise Has No Purpose!
A Movie For A High School Drop Out,AshamedThat I EvenSaw It
Okay folks, say it with me-- this is not a horror movie.
ONCE AGAIN, LIONGATES MAKE A GREAT HORROR MOVIE!
smart clever  twisted , without explanation but who cares?
SAW
To really see Saw, you have to watch it again and again
"A Thrill Ride"
I highly recommend the SAW movies
Excellente!
Been to long waiting for a good film
A Gem
Brilliantly sick and twisted...if you can stomach it
BETTER THAN YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE!
An awesome new horror-thriller classic now better then ever on DVD!
Just Barely One Cut Above the Rest.
Don't saw sawdust
He makes them kill themselves at their own game
Awesome Movie
See Saw.
How much blood are you willing to shed...?
Didn't quite have me riveted to the screen...
Grotesque movie with an interesting story...
OK but not great
3 & a half
brilliant
Very original!
Not bad
Incredibly underrated!!!
Excellent Movie
Ending is awesome
True creative chaos
A THRILLER THAT DELIVERS!
Freaky
Saw - The double meaning is killer
Stellar Film
Promising but a bit amateurish
Saw...See It!
Not perfect, but basically a good horror movie
3 AND A HALF....NOT 5 BECAUSE OF CARL EWLES
Saw it, liked it, but would easily forget it...
I went, I "Saw"..I hated.
Cut off Your Own Foot Instead...................
A Big Disappointment
Oh no there isnt as much blood as you'd expect, o well, still good
A great movie
A MUST TO WATCH FOR ALL GORE/HORROR FANS
Nice
One of the best twists in a movie ive ever seen!!!

_ S_A_W_  .....not your typical murder movies.....
Wow!
One of the better horror films of this time
ONE OF THE MOST WELL THOUGHT OUT HORROR FILMS OF THE DECADE!
One Sick Movie Which Is Supposed To Be "A Psychological Thriller"!
It doesn't get much better
its gorey
What Would YOUR First Movie Look Like?...
Great
Heck Yeah! Must See!
Original and disturbing
Wait...its good?
Great movie!!!
Whew - very disturbing movie - loved it!
Scariest ive seen since Seven
Gripping but gory thriller/horror film
EXTREMELY VIOLENT YET MORALISTIC AT THE VERY SAME TIME
Squandered Potential
Great movie, disappointing Blu-ray
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you, not any more...
How much blood would you shed to stay alive?
See Saw.
I liked it!
This is entertainment!
For those who want more of the same.....
O.K Movie
SEE-SAW
A cut above the average.
nice and gory
Well done thriller overall, with one terrific perfomance.
Comes real close to being a classic, but...
Sick, twisted,  and FUN!
BY FAR ONE OF THE FREAKEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN EVER!!!!!!!!!!
Good Flick
Delving into the human psyche.
A rather intriguing and innovative horror flick
only seen bootleg of internet but it was awsome
A great horror title !!!!!!
Mind Rot @ Its Most Blatant!
This one belongs to the razzies....
What do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror?
Can you say masterpiece?
I WONDER IF THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CAN HACK THESE GAMES.
" let the games begin"
Great movie
The best somewhat recent Horror/thriller
Wish I hadn't seen this...
SAW it and LOVED it.
ITS THE RULES!
DIRTY, GRIMY, FILTHY AND ORIGINAL
Eh..
Some praise for a movie which hands down deserves it
"Saw" is badly overated
Looks like a made-for-tv movie
Not as great as everyone says..
BRAVO!!!!
I just SAW the worst film of the year......God that's awfull
Classic
Did you see what I Saw?
Blood, Guts, Poor Ending
FREAKY
This movie is a waste of your time

3.5; it's a great attempt that falls short
4 Stars for a very valiant effort
Saw is Life...
A big gore-fest.
Finally a horror film that makes you think
Good idea, bad acting
This movie got me  revived!
"He helped me"
Amazing. Suspense.
Another low budget horror flick that works.
Different
Sadistic  fun
Perfect in concept, though flawed in execution
Not great, but cool twist you won't see coming
See Saw?
A great film
Raw and creepy...ending will freek you out
You'll Never Guess The Ending....
This psychopath could give Hannibal Lector nightmares.
Lions Gate Film brings another MASTERPIECE !!!
Top of the line thriller
Nail biting, keeps you interested from start to end
Ok what's the matter with it?
bad acting by main character, but excellent story makes up
ITS GREAT BUT NOT MUCH GORE!
Awful
When awful is not a strong enough word
It's OK
good, but the second is better
I  bought it because of the packaging
Clever and scary as hell!
Worth the Full Price of Admission
Horrifically magnificent.
You have to See Saw
HORrorS DE OUVRES ..............
I Thought, So What If The Main Characters Die.
What WOULD you do??
SAW: I'm sorry, but WOW!!!

Just taken from other movies
Excellent Plot
A Grisly Film with Few True Frights
Intriguing, if gruesome movie
YOU WANT SCARY AND UNSETTLING - THIS IS SCARY AND UNSETTLING!!!
Better than "Silence of the lambs"
Saw is a original horror that will really scare you
This is NOT a Bad Movie
What a waste of time
Waste of time
The absolute worst way to spend time
Waste neither time nor money on this crap

Best of the 3 Movies...
excellent
brilliantly twisted
A MAZE OF NIGHTMARES
One of the biggest surprises in films
Forget about Freddy......Worry about Jigsaw!
pretty good, but the gore comes in way after it should have.
Lots of blood and a Plot!
DEFINITELY WORTH MY TIME
Intense Stuff
Great Movie!!
Good, Clean, Scary Fun
Entertaining, But Not Much Else
Don't get trapped in the men's bathroom.
Not bad, but not really that good either.
A wolf, caught in a trap, will chew his leg off to escape
More of a "crime" movie than a horror movie
Not horrible.
Slightly hacked off
I was too scared NOT to see this movie.
Genius!
Uncut?
excellent story and gruesomely satisfying scenes!
Bloody and Brilliant, Hampered by Acting
Offers some scares but more than anything is a rip-off
Me Saw...... Me like........
Bone Chilling
Silly
I Like Roger Ebert but I Disagree About This Film
"I'll F*** anything that moves"
A great buy for Lynch fans!
Good stuff, through and through!

Watch Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Movie was fine, Amazon Video, never again.
Entry Point
Still vibrant after all these years
It Draws You In...
Lynchian Twisted Noir
Lynch's Most Famous Movie? I Think So!
Very close to velvety smooth...
A controversial and beautiful film from a master
A Classic Modern Film Noir
This is "Blue Velvet"
Unquestionably a classic film, but...
By Far,  Still One of the Creepiest Moovys Ever Made.....
The world is brutal, but who knows it?
A neat reworking of a subgenre
Love it or Leave it - That's the beauty
Stunning
One of the most unique and unsettling films of all time!
Wait for the new edition
A classic David Lynch film
Not all it's cracked up to be
A baroque thriller!
This movie gets a love letter from me
Interesting and Disturbing Film.
The candy-coated Clown they call the Sandman...
Now Its Dark
One of the greatest of 80's...if not all time
Lynchians have to see
Sinematic Nightmares
audacious! provacative! nearly 20 years old, still acute
Whoa!
Lynch's Best, Maybe the Best
Sorry... not very good at all
It's Daddy, you S**thead! Where's my bourbon??!!'
Unidimensionality
An astonishingly conventional film that isn't nearly as subversive as it thinks it is
A disturbing vision of Americana
David Lynch's masterpiece
In dreams.
A Shocking Masterpiece
Lush Greens and Perversity
&quot;Yep, that's a human ear alright&quot;
Definitely a nightmare.
A Milestone
Interesting, but not a classic
Best Film Ever
I liked it a lot.
yummy! =)
Lynche does it again!!!
Lynch's best movie, yet...
One line reviews; &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;
now its dark
The Best Film of the 1980's
Blu-ray (4.5 stars): Would have loved new special features for this 25th anniversary release but still a must-buy!
DISTURBING, BEAUTIFUL, HORRIFYING, BIZARRE & SURREAL
An unforgettable movie experience.
To think I used to HATE this film...
As coherent as it needs to be.
A CLASSIC MASTERPIECE
Deleted photo stills...?????!!!!!
One of the best of the '80s
Weird, Twisted and Classic Lynch
Great movie in need of more features!
The first time Lynch made a typical Lynch-movie
One of the finest horror films ever made.
Definitely an ear-full.
She wears...
Great Movie
Necessary Lynch
Lynch's masterpiece, all other opinions and perspectives are void
Dennis Hopper is great!!!!!
NO RESOLUTION!
Artful, surreal portrait of the normal and the deviant
Good for renting but not for collecting..
One of the most important chapters in modern americancinema!
Right brain vs left brain-&gt; everyone wins!
Brilliant, fun, wacky, sublime. Best of the 80s.
This movie is so hard to discuss...
The worst DVD encoding - ever!
Begins Well, but The End Looses Steam
Living Large
Isabella Rossellini: Not Beautiful...just Sexy!
Hypnotic in it's erotic/ lovely horrific nature
Don't look at me
Ludicrous precursor to Twin Peaks
Weird
One of the best films of all time

The Candy Colored Clown
shaun316 is an idiot

Dissappointing
Good..Bad.. Ugly...
AMAZING

LYNCH'S MASTERPIECE
a masterpiece??- i think not
Confusing
Warm and Fuzzy!!
Very unsettling and confusing movie!
a comment on the DVD (not the film - which is brilliant btw)
Art thou entertainment?
I know the suburbs, and this isn't the suburbs
Dennis Hopper, the two stars are for you
Not classic
Fun for the whole Family!
This is only comparable to Lynch's other movies
Good plot, direction, and scenes, but some bad acting.
Blah, blah, blah
Dennis is the reason I gave it 2, otherwise 1 star
WELL...IT'S GOT ALOT OF PRETTY COLORS.
Overrated Drivel
about the movie blue velvet...........
the way
This movie was BAD with a capital "B"
Weird film
Coming of Age and loss of innocence.
Faux-Bizarre Failure
A Masterpiece? NO way
Isabella Rossellini!
Waste of Time
The Citizen Kane of bad movies
Great Movie
Unseemly, Nasty and Rank
This 'Masterpiece' is the Perfect Example of Bandwagon Overrating
Bad bad movie
Mediocre DVD Release of an Important Film
Newly discovered footage...
A must-see for fans of surreal offbeat film noir
A dizzying, haunting masterpiece
BIZARRE & OFTEN SHOCKING, BUT A DARING EXPOSE..
A Candy Colored Clown They Call the Sandman

Sex, knives, oxygen and bugs, YUMMY!
Lynch = bizarre genius or crazy madman milking his art?
Great movie if like the sick night people
