It's the same DVD as Death By Decibels .. Read those reviews.<br /><br />The producers put out the same DVD, which BTW has little to do with the band, under several different titles with different covers in order to rip-off the fans of a band the producers have nothing to do with. The cover gives you no clue that the Deftones are not on this DVD.<br /><br />I also got ripped off by buying the same Muse DVD twice by producers who had nothing to do with the band.<br /><br />In future I will be reading the review of a music DVD before buying from a music store.<br /><br />This sort of crap only serves to hurt the bands, the music stores and the music industry in general. As a fan, I feel like I've been ripped off and will get stuff from the Internet for free instead, so ensuring that I don't waste my hard-earned money.<br /><br />Les.
