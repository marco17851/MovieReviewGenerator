This sure is the best horror film I have ever watched.It's not scary-it has a twisted plot,and a chilly view from the director's eye.It doesn't feauture much violence either,but this is covered by far by the psychological pressure that the characters get from Jigsaw,and how he changes their lifes.Jigsaw is not like most cinematic killers.He's a mad person who tries to actually help people through his insanity.Through the film you'll be amazed by how good the script is written,linking so many facts from the movie into one,gasping conclusion.<br /><br />When the end titles appeared,I just stayed right there,still watching,amazed by the ending.Trust me,I guess the killer most of the times in the movies,but in this one,it didn't even crossed my mind.So grand is the revealance of the killer,that it will propably give you a reason to watch it for a second time,since by knowing the killer already,you will watch the movie in a whole new experience.
This movie is about a seriel killer that tries to get his victims to kill themselves or someone else. Unique idea, but the story - although not much of one - doesn't hold up.<br /><br />I won't ruin the ending, but if you ever see it, you'll be a little mad because it ends up making most of the movie nonsensical and preposterous. Instead of making the serial killer into something believable, he ends up being something like a Jason or a Freddie.<br /><br />Based on how this movie ended, you can almost guarantee they'll be a sequel that I'll be sure to miss.
First of all, I can't complain enough about all of the PG-13 "scary" movies coming out. Even Wes Craven's new flick has been slated PG-13. It almost sickens me. Even if Saw was completely horrible, which it isn't, it would still get points in my book for at least being R. Saw proves to be a great reminder of why scary movies need to be R.<br /><br />Saw is an uncomfortable psychological thriller that follows in the footsteps of David Fincher. Think of the savagery and bloodiness of Seven with the atmosphere and puzzlement of The Game. Saw is extremely well-paced, has some great visiual (often disturbing) imagery, and has an awesome ending you won't see coming for a thousand miles. And I can't stress the fact that it is rated R enough. What more do you want?
I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie, but I'm glad that I did.  If you like sick and twisted psychological thrillers, then you will like this movie.  There is no way you can figure out the ending.  There are so many twists and turns in this movie.  Even when the movie is over you will be asking yourself questions.  It's good, really really good.
"Live or die. Make your choice." - Jigsaw lays down the law in "Saw"<br /><br />Carey Elwes, Danny Glover, & Monica Potter star in this semi-thriller that has some lukewarm twists, but, comes off as another rip-off of "Se7en".<br /><br />Dr. Lawrence Gordan awakens to find himself barefoot and chained to outer piping in a disgusting, & decrepit men's room, with no recollection of how or why he got there. He isn't alone as he discovers Adam, a young man in the same predicament as Gordan  sitting in the opposite corner of the room. But, worst of all is, in the center of the room a dead male face down in its own pool of blood with a gun in one hand and micro-cassette player in the other.<br /><br />After some clue searching, both men discover that there the pawns of a deadly game orchestrated by a serial killer who has a penchant for playing twisted games, in which he is the only winner. This particular game has Dr. Gordan killing Adam and going free. But, if Gordan doesn't kill Adam by 6 P.M., his wife & daughter will be slaughtered and Gordan will rot in his chains until his death. With time winding down to the dinner time hour, its up to Dr. Gordan to figure a way out and save everyone from certain death.<br /><br />"Saw" is one of those films that tries to scare, disturb, &  offend at the same time, but comes up short in each category. The film won't have you losing sleep over it & it's nothing to write home about. There are a few good shots in the film though. The twisty ending is okay, too.<br /><br />Carey Elwes gets the wussiest performance of the year as the shackled doctor. By the time he gets to do some fatal cutting, I could care if he lived or died, with the all the crying & whimpering that carried on. Danny Glover channels the dark side of Roger Murtaugh, the cop he played in the "Lethal Weapon" quadrilogy & his performance isn't near as menacing enough as the characters he portrayed in "The Color Purple" & "Witness". Monica Potter is window dressing at best with a decent fight scene at the end.<br /><br />"Saw" is a decent enough time passer (catch it when it hits HBO), but it just doesn't have enough teeth.
i've been waiting a long time to see this movie. well i just went and saw it but i was about as satisfied as when you order a pepperoni pizza and get it with no cheese. i thought the storyline was phenomenol, the acting was good although i think dr. gordons character by the end will have some audiences laughing, but the ending leaves you knowing that it was just for shock value.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead!!<br /><br />at the end of this movie we find out that the killer was just another pawn to the real killer. but then we have to find out who that killer was. i think that the ending should have just been left at that and let the audience make up their own suspects<br /><br />just a thought.
The first movie is the best, there is very little blood.  It's mostly a psychological thriller.  You will be shocked at the end.  The others in the series became gore fests, no real writing in them.
I expected to be entertained, frightened, and disturbed by this film.<br /><br />Instead, I was bored, disappointed, and disgusted.<br /><br />You can get better violence in any action movie; you can get a better psychological thrill from 'Silence of the Lambs' or even a cheesy sci-fi like 'Event Horizon'; you get more plausibility out of 'Lord of the Rings'. At least Lord of the Rings doesn't pretend to be reality.<br /><br />In 'Saw', the film's apparently omiscient, omnipotent, and short sightedly self-righteous 'Jigsaw Killer' sets ridiculously contrived and unnecessary traps for his victims. That's pretty much it. Maybe he's a surviving henchman from some old Bond film?<br /><br />There are a dozen points in the movie when an intelligent person says, "Wait, why would they do that?" and the movie loses all its plausibility. The characters act and interact in ways that only the most unintelligent and illogical people would; in order for the plot to progress as it does, the screenwriters throw one deus ex machina after another at you.<br /><br />I can only take so many absurd twists and revelations before realizing that I got swindled. If you were thrilled by this idiotic film... kudos, I'm glad you don't feel gypped. That makes one of us, at least.
First off I guess I should explain the title to me review. Well you see this was one of a very few movies that I didn't have figured out before the end. I was genuinely suprized at the end,that don't happen to me much. Thats one of the main things I liked about this movie also it has some creative ideas on the whole genre. I mean before watching this movie who would have ever thought of killing people in that manner. The acting is pretty standard for the genre so I won't comment on that any further. So if your looking for a Suspenseful Horror flick you must watch this.
Not perfect, but still a nifty little movie with a clever premise and a few good scares.  The opening of the movie is wonderful; two men wake up to find themselves chained up in a dirty bathroom with a dead man on the floor between them.  The rest of the movie, however, tends to get a little too formulaic; we have the bizarre serial killer, the obsessed detective, the good guy who may or may not be the killer himself...although the movie does move away from teh cliches at times and shows flashes of brilliance, it can't hold a candle to the wonderful film Seven.  First of all, the acting is too melodramatic; Carey Elwes and Danny Glover, among others, just seem flat and unconvincing at times.  The writer of the film, who felt the need to cast himself in one of the main roles, clearly needs a little more practice before he tackles another big part.  All in all, though, the movie zips along at a good pace and rates high on the "creepy" meter.  The plot twists and surprises are devious and hair-raising, and even if there are a few unanswered questions at the end of the film, Saw still provides a good scary thrill ride.
A great many people, it would appear, hold the film "Saw" in high regard. It was at the behest of numerous co-workers and friends that I finally ran out with my spouse and snagged a rental of this rather curious title. While I can certainly credit the film for taking a fresh route so completely unorthodox and visually arresting, I still must conclude that I found the whole thing rather lacking.<br /><br />The concept of two people struggling to solve the puzzle of why they were abducted and squared away together with the threat of death looming over their heads could, and should, have been handled with far greater care and intelligence. Having already seen David Fincher's far superior "Seven," I could not bring myself to connect with anything this film had to offer. It was nothing more than a carbon-copy of so many other better films and didn't really seem to have any valid point. I think that is what hurts this film the most, aside from the fact that Danny Glover and Cary Elwes were totally miscast. The writing, in some areas, is so bad that you wonder how the script was ever approved. Key points in the film offer golden opportunities for Glover's character to end Jigsaw's murderous campaign. But he winds up dropping the ball in a manner no real authority figure ever would. The ending is a particular disappointment, because it foolishly leaves the door wide open for a highly unnecessary sequel when it honestly didn't have to.<br /><br />"Saw" does have a good concept, like I said. But the overall execution of the material left me cold and frustrated. To this moment, I still do not understand why it receives such over-rated hype. To each their own, I suppose.
When the credits rolled at the end of Saw, I almost laughed at how  preposterous and desperate this movie is. There are so many disconnects in logic and narrative throughout this movie but they are only apparent in retrospect, when the movie ends and you are shown what was "really" going on. First of all, the villain is first seen as an incapacitated patient with an inoperable brain tumor, but we are expected to believe that he can find the time, money and energy to organize and engineer the monumentally complicated traps in which he places his victims. And, no, you can't fake the neurological, opthalmological and laboratory manifestations of a brain tumor, and you sure as hell can't fake a massive brain tumor on your own MRI scan, so don't tell me this was all just part of the villain's plan. It's bogus and nonsensical.<br /><br />I mentioned the complicated traps. I mean they are WAY complicated. Every detail, every contingency, every nuance has been anticipated and thought out to the ten thousandth degree. The planning, the execution, the timing, the physical construction of the settings for the traps..hell, it would take months if not a year to put all this together. It simply rings false. It is not believable, and this inability to believe and trust in the story contaminates the viewer's enjoyment of the film. Now we come to a plot device that the writers fall back on several times during Saw, the "slow acting poison." We are asked repeatedly to believe that the characters are acting as they do because they believe they have ingested "slow acting poison." They act completely irrationally, violently, and become all caught up in these mega-complex scenarios all because they believe they are dying from "slow-acting poison"? Doesn't anyone  go to the Emergency Room? Sorry, slow acting poison sounds like a lazy plot device from a second-rate high school play, not the engine that drives a major motion picture.<br /><br />Now, let's talk about the acting. Bad. Embarrassingly, amateurishly bad. Sometimes, especially when the actor who plays the doctor is speaking, the acting literally struck me like a satire of bad acting. I half-expected him to wink at the camera.<br /><br />Dammit, you may ask, why can't I just relax, suspend my critical faculties, and simply enjoy the movie for what it is, instead of condemn it for what it isn't? Here's why. This ain't that kind of movie. Yeah, when I watched the Exorcist, or the Omen, or the Shining, yes, those movies don't pretend that they are based in gritty reality and don't depend on our familiarity with serial killers, religious psychopaths and other wingnuts in order to obtain their scariness. This movie,like Seven, is grounded in the fact that the audience knows there are really creepy people in the world, and it is this connection with our own reality that is supposed to give the movie its power. Seven succeeded. This movie, however, fails. We can't suspend disbelief, like we do when we watch the Shining, but we are still jarred into disbelief by preposterous plot elements and wretched acting. The viewer is stuck, unable to believe, unable to suspend disbelief, waiting for the credits to roll. It's like drinking slow acting poison.
...we're all in some serious trouble.<br /><br />As a huge fan of horror films for years, I was very excited to (finally) see "Saw" when it made it out on DVD. A compelling sereal killer, some graphic violence, that creepy laughing clown ... how could you go wrong?<br /><br />For starters, the acting is awful. It's sad to watch Cary Elwes absolutely mail in a performance like this - he had such verve and charisma in "The Princess Bride," but here he seems very ill-suited and even a little bored. Leigh Whannell is only slightly more convincing as his cell-mate. Danny Glover is Danny Glover. He's an effective character actor, and he could have been used to much greater effect here.<br /><br />Then the directing. This might just be my personal taste, but the nonstop MTV type sound blurts and quick-cut camera effect is badly overused in many movies, and it seems particularly inappropriate for the horror genre. It's been done before, and in "Saw" it manages to crush any atmosphere or suspense.<br /><br />And finally, the plot. "Saw" clearly draws its inspiration from "Seven," with a little bit of "Silence of the Lambs," "The Cell" and "The Usual Suspects" thrown in for good measure. The movie makes the mistake of being far more clever than it needs to be - tacking on badly contrived and unlikely twists to an already shaky plot.<br /><br />Note to Hollywood directors: A "twist" is only satisfying if it makes logical sense within the context of the picture. When you pull some minor non-character out of a totally unrelated scene and make him the most important player in the movie for no other reason than to surprise the audience, we won't care. And I didn't.<br /><br />But what annoyed me most about "Saw" was its self-serious attitude. A less proficient director probably could've turned this material into cheesy high camp. Instead, "Saw" is so heavy-handed and devoid of fun that I seriously considered turning it off midway through.<br /><br />Two stars for some graphic violence, a rarity in mainstream horror films these days. I'd have given it 2 1/2 if we were treated to some pointless nudity (sadly, everybody keeps their clothes on).
4.5 stars<br /><br />It has been a very, very long time since I've walked away from a horror/suspense/serial killer film nearly pumping my fist into the air. FINALLY, my faith in American suspense has been restored. Never have I said this, but not since The Silence of the Lambs (the undisputed king of this genre) has a movie affected me as strongly - although the aforementioned film is still leaps and bounds ahead of Saw.<br /><br />Comments about poor acting have been made. I don't necessarily agree. My question would be: what were people expecting from Elwes? He's not exactly Oscar material, though I've enjoyed his performances in several films. As far as the rest of the acting, it was extravagantly believable. There wasn't a second during this movie that I wasn't entirely, fully engaged: and that simply can not be accomplished without good acting. Story and plot only take you so far.<br /><br />This movie achieved something that very few do. Examples of what I'm about to mention would be David Mamet's House of Games and The Spanish Prisoner. All three of these films lead you to believe that you know exactly what's going on, and that empowers the viewer - you think you know something that the characters on the screen do not. However, you find, even when warned that you are going to be tricked, that you *still* fall for it. You are entirely controlled by the film.<br /><br />The settings are immaculate, and the camera angles and lighting serve to bring the viewer into the movie. This is easily one of the best films of the year. Yes, horror/suspense can be considered "one of the best" - remember, the aforementioned The Silence of the Lambs won the "Big Five" Oscars: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. Granted, I don't think that Saw will win any of these because it was a tad too formulaic (with a few Scream-like scenes in it), and it lacked the one thing that Silence had: Anthony Hopkins. Still, it was an amazing film.
From those who liked Saw (2004) `A Cut Above the Rest', `I Came, I Saw', `See Saw', `One Severed Thumb Up', `What I Saw Was Good', to those who didn't, `(S)awful', `Wish I Never Saw This', `Saw Just Couldn't Cut It', `Saw It Coming', it seems like many of the clever title variations have already been used, leaving me with...nothing (okay, it's early and I was up late last night, so gimme a break)...co-written and directed by James Wan, the film stars Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Days of Thunder) and Leigh Whannell, who co-wrote the film with director Wan.  Also appearing is Danny Glover (Grand Canyon, Gone Fishin'), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers - she was the redhead who got topless in the group shower), Ken Leung (Vanilla Sky), Shawnee Smith, whom many may recognize from television's Becker as the dumb as a brick character of Linda, and cute as a button Monica Potter (Along Came a Spider).<br /><br />The movie opens, oddly enough, in my bathroom, or, at least a very good facsimile...it's dark, dank, slimy, dirty, gritty, moldy, and generally funkified, as my good friend Robbie Van Winkle used to say, to the extreme.  As the florescent lights come to life, we see three men, two alive, one dead (I'm assuming this as he was laying face down on the icky tile in a pool of his own blood with a ginormous hole in the back of his head).  The two remaining men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) and Adam (Whannell), find themselves not only wondering how they came to be in such a place, but why they are shackled by the ankle to large pipes, each at opposite ends of the room.  Some answers are found on cassette tapes found in their respective pockets (the dead man in the middle of the room had a player) in that of a raspy voice and various clues that indicate the survival of the two men, among others, depends on their having to perform some unusual acts (two men in a bathroom performing unusual acts?  No, this isn't a George Michael video...).  The question soon becomes one of what someone would be willing to do to stay alive, and the answers may shock you...<br /><br />The general opinion for Saw seems clearly divided, and I can see both sides...but I enjoyed this nasty little movie, for what it was...so many have already compared it to (or claimed it ripped off) the popular film Se7en, so it must be true, but I found myself likening the tone of the film to the ambiguously dark and disturbing videos released by the band Tool in the 90's (I think they're still performing, but with a slightly different line up).  I think most agree the acting in Saw isn't the best, Cary Elwes' performance the most flawed, and there's a good many plot holes, but I think the good outweighed the bad, and the end result was favorable.  I was a little disappointed that Glover and Potter's roles weren't more substantial, but the upside was the story moved at a brisk pace.  The movie had a really strong opening, and kept me interested throughout, although it did sort of peter out as it went along...I will say that not once did I look at the running time left to figure out how much more I had to sit through (I'll do this often with films that bore me).  Did I find the movie scary?  Not really, but it was tense, unsettling, and definitely creepy.  I like how things unfolded, as the audience starts out knowing exactly what the main characters do, which is very little, and then revelations present themselves, but even as we become more informed (more so than the main characters), what are we to believe?  One or two of these elements were easy to discern as a means to throw us off (especially those regarding the identity of the mysterious Jigsaw killer, as he was named), but for the most part, I found myself second-guessing my theories.  The sets for the film so clearly fit the dark nature of the material, especially the dilapidated bathroom where a majority of the story took place.  My favorite scene involved Adam, learning from a clue that there may be something of use in the toilet, reaching into the thick, brown, water in the bowl...I dunno about you, but I would've checked the tank first, as I think most know the best place to hide something in a toilet would be the tank, and not the bowl... Dr, Gordon then asks, "Find anything?", to which Adam replies, "Nothing solid..." Hee hee...he then realizes it's the tank he should be looking in, and admonishes himself appropriately.  No, this isn't a comedy, but it does have a few humorous moments that were integrated nicely to enhance an overall sense of realism.  I wouldn't call this a straight up horror film, but more of a crime thriller with horror elements.  The main element that really intrigued me was the idea of placing people in situations where they have the choice of doing nothing and dying, or doing something really dangerous and quite possibly lethal (to themselves or others) for the remote chance of surviving (You know, if the producers of that Fear Factor show had any cajones, they would more closely model their show on this concept...it'd be a ratings bonanza).  In the end, looking at the film for what it is, an inexpensive (under 2 mil, I think), quickly shot (18 days), glossy initial outing, I'd say it turned out very well, and is worth checking out for a few thrills.<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen print looks great, with matching audio.  Special features include a short featurette titled `Sawed Off), rated and unrated version of the Cold Play video `Bite the Hand That Bleeds You', trailers and TV spots, a poster gallery, a commentary track with Wan and Whannell, and a cool, transparent case with an artwork overlay.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, if you dug this cinematic nugget, be on the lookout for the sequel, aptly titled Saw II, coming sometime in 2005.
This DVD comes in a very chic clear box, that's the good news - the bad news is everything else.  The real horror of Saw is watching a fine actor like Danny Glover damage his reputation by appearing in it - I would suggest that a much more interesting film could be made showing how a gentleman like Mr. Glover could be driven to such desperate ends.  After that, the most disturbing thing about Saw is the pretensions to intellectualism exhibited by its director, James Wan, and writer Leigh Whannell (who also acts like a person acting in the picture).<br /><br />These individuals have studied their betters carefully, combing through Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and more obscure efforts like Deathtrap and Sleuth.  Indeed, if these two had any skill at all, they might have structured the film as a play and shot the whole thing in that filthy room with the two protagonists and alleged corpse. Unfortunately, they aren't clever; they just want you to believe they are.  What drives all four of those better films is fantastic characters whose obsessions and peculiarities are fascinating.  Saw offers us a women slitting open the belly of a man so that she can paw through his intestines in time to find the key that will save her from having her head split in half.  (Edward Albee eat your heart out!)<br /><br />Which brings us to Jigsaw, the mastermind behind these devious "hands-off" killings, orchestrated so ingeniously.  Just where do the Jigsaws of the world come from?  These psychopaths seem to have unlimited time and resources, whiling away the hours dreaming up imaginative tortures, leaving lots of cleverly encrypted clues, adding presentational flair and panache to their intricate delivery, and of course, spending countless hours on victim research and pre-planning diabolical snares.  How convenient for everyone!<br /><br />If you're a 14-year old boy and video games aren't violent enough for you, you will find something satisfying in Saw.  However, if you know better, but you just have a hankering for senseless gore and mayhem, spare yourself the pseudo-intellectualism and get High Tension instead.
While I will admit, with several other critics, that the acting was not great, I must resort to a comment that I made in my Grudge comment.  I did not come into this film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting.  I came into this film expecting to be impressed with a story that I hadn't seen and some imagery that would resonate throughout my mind long after the film was over.  Saw successfully accomplished this task.  While I will admit that it is nowhere close to toppling the popular Se7en, it did stand on its own two fee and provide some interesting thoughts about life and the choices we must make when placed into life-challenging moments.  It was classy in the way that it presented the story, staying away from the pitfall of being too gory, it instead placed more emphasis on simplicity and raw human emotions.  What impressed me about Saw is that it revamped the age-old Hollywood formula for these types of films.  That is what ultimately made this ending so difficult to decode.  I thought I knew exactly what was happening up until the final key moments when my mind shattered and the wildly implausible became a reality.  That is what pushed this film from your average "serial killer" film to a wickedly delightful noir-styled thriller.<br /><br />I continue reading more reviews about the acting in this film and how under par it was.  I would like to quickly mention that you are working with two of the teetering "B" to "C" grade actors of our generation.  Cary Elwes and Danny Glover could be classified as 80s superstars, but as the years passed they found themselves with less and less work, thus fading their acting ability.  After the Lethal Weapon films, I am not sure I have seen Glover in anything worth writing home about, while Elwes can be said that his career went down after Robin Hood: Men in Tights.  So, you are not dealing with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of Hollywood, but instead two actors who read a story that was original and chilling at the same time and chose to jump onto the project for sheer enjoyment.  While their acting is not outstanding, their effort and overall feeling of excitement cannot be matched.  You can watch huge blockbuster films and think to yourself that the $20 million dollar actors are just doing it to sustain the lifestyle that they have and ultimately their performances don't seem to reach their pay scale, then you can watch these smaller, limited budget films like Saw, and appreciate the work that the actors are doing.  I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with the critics out there that the acting wasn't great, but there was excitement and appreciation for their roles, and I have to give them credit for that.<br /><br />Outside of the acting, this film impressed me.  The originality of the story shocked me.  I thought it was going to be this unoriginal butcher/killer film, but instead it turned into this deeply thematic film about the values that we place on our lives as humans.  Without giving anything away, you have to appreciate what this supposed "killer" is doing to his victims.  The killer is opening the eyes of those that have taken their life and literally thrown it out the window.  While I do not think that it was done in the most appropriate way, this film did allow your mind to open.  Just like in Se7en when our killer is talking to Pitt and Freeman in the back of the police car, the words and ideas that are created will remain with you for a very long time.  Saw was a very intelligent film that coupled gruesome scenes of violence with the apathy of human existence.  To me, it worked.<br /><br />I am also extremely passionate about films that allow you to discuss the possibilities of the ending, middle, or even the beginning.  Any film that evokes conversation the moment is has finished, in my book, has done a great job.  Now, if the conversation is continually about the negative aspects of the film, then it succeeded in making a bad film, if the conversation is about the great moments, the endless possibilities, and the deeply rooted themes that pertain to life in general, than the film was successful in being good.  I despise those films that just shoot for the middle of the road, forcing you to walk away from the film or theater just not caring that you just spent your hard-earned money and time into the film.  Those films are a waste in my book.  Saw had, actually, still has me thinking about the different possibilities of the ending.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I finished the film thinking ... wow, but what does this mean?  How did this happen?  Where are we going from here?  Yada yada yada ... (did I just yada yada yada Saw?)  I could have watched it a second time back to back just to find points that I missed.  Any film that makes it exciting and interactive deserves some respect in my book ... and Saw earned it.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a much better film that I was expecting. The deeply rooted themes of human life and our choices to praise what is handed before us are strong and not often argued in film.  While the acting was about average, I did not walk into this film expecting to be blown away by performances, it was the bigger picture that I was more excited about.  Saw worked well as a whole, from the acting to the story, all the pieces put together brought a very enjoyable movie to the table, but if you look at them separately, you will not find the enjoyment, just random bits of chaos.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****
This is definitely one of those movies which you probably need to see to more than once to pick up on everything. A real psychological thriller. I'm still thinking about it a few days after I saw it. Especially the image of the character sawing off his leg and the state of mind he was in when he was doing it. Disgusting and disturbing.<br /><br />It's like the movie Phonebooth in the sense that the killer toys with his victims. Putting them through psychological distress and forcing them to make choices. It is not an extremely gory movie but it shows enough to have an effect. The movie is also atypical in the sense that it does not involve a parallel story of police detectives solving the 'jigsaw' crimes and eventually capturing the killer. In fact, the detectives either get killed or go mad and then get killed. The fact that the criminal isn't brought to justice in the end adds to the disturbing nature of the film.<br /><br />The movie misdirects on many occasions so that it can surprise you later. They give you quick glimpses of the killer, and just when you think you were clever enough to spot his face and figure out who he is, you get a surprise! Quite an intriguing movie to see if you're up for being disturbed afterwards.
I decided, after watching "SAW 3" this weekend, to give this movie another look-see, to re-evaluate and check if my original thoughts had changed over the past three years. Nope.<br /><br />"Saw" is a hack-job of a movie, cribbed from superior scripts like "Se7en" and "The Cube," where victims get lured into totally illogical situations in some psychopath's attempt at teaching them a lesson. But "Saw" completely lacks "The Cube's" fascist police state backdrop or "Se7en's" gruesome moral bent. Instead, two random men, (writer/director Leigh Whannel and Cary Elwes) are trapped in some music video concept of a warehouse bathroom with a dead man, gun and tape deck between them. And things go downhill from there.<br /><br />Cary Elwes' acting is so strident that he becomes funny by the final act, as he simply just doesn't have the chops to portray that madness he's succumbing to. Danny Glover - obviously slumming it - turns into a hysterical twit as time rolls on. Whannel is so cardboard that you need only to look at his other credentials to understand how he got his part. Dialogue is beyond corny. And that's just the actors.<br /><br />When you get to the script, the continuity is howlingly laughable. Men step from bathtubs and are dry. Items removed from water are also dry. Blood appears on victim's clothing and disappears. And in one of the most hysterically ridiculous gaffs in modern movies, a truck involved in the chase scene changes MODELS by the end of the chase!<br /><br />OK so I sat through the whole thing two times. But the movie's concept is relatively slick - enough to lure in scared patrons to two sequels and make Tobin Bell's Jigsaw one of the better movie villains in recent horror genres. (Incidentally, I feel "Saw 2" to be the best of the three films, and "Saw 3" a shade better than the original if only by benefit of better budget and better acting.) But if you take your horror/suspense movies seriously, you'll understand just how "Scary Movie 4" made hash out of "Saw" with barely an effort.
This film is far from being one of the scariest movies (ever).<br />Whether you do not care about the plot and acting and you just want to enjoy, take it. However, if you want to see a good made Horror movie, I'm afraid Saw's not for you. The acting is bad (That Adam guy - God bless him, I laughed my head off every time he opened his mouth), the plot doesn't make sense and there's nothing psychological in it or whatsover. It's here where Saw fails and makes you laugh insted of being scared. It's not that is a horrible movie, but watching it, you just don't care much. Well, I didn't anyway. The story wasn't shown in a credible way so you could have the chance to sympathize with the characters.
Perhaps one would need to see the whole movie to make this decision.  I couldn't.  I've never had a strong stomach.  I love thrillers, abhor horror.  The difference is that horror relies on splatter, thrillers on playing with your mind.<br /><br />I thought this movie was more thriller than horror when I rented it.  If it was truly in the vein of Seven, then the movie really wouldn't be overtly graphic.  It would just be outrageously disturbing.  Disturbing is fine.  That's why Seven and Identity are a couple of my more favorite movies.  They are psychologically disturbing without offending your visual sensibilities.  I was hoping Saw would be that way.<br /><br />I think this is a movie that will appeal to many people.  If you like horror, or if gore doesn't bother you, this movie has a great premise and some decent acting.  (If you rent this movie hoping for some redeaming message, stay away.)<br /><br />For me, though, the movie was so relentlessly brutal that I just couldn't watch it all.  So, if you're like me and you enjoy movies that play with your mind and not your eyes, stay away from this movie.  If you're the kind of person that likes your mind and eyes being played with, you'll probably enjoy the movie.
How people can just arbitrarily say what constitutes good acting and bad acting?  I've heard a great deal of people say this and that about Carey Elwes' performance in this film.  Most people say he overdid it.  Well sorry to say this, but I highly doubt any of them have ever seen how someone would behave in that sort of situation.  Overdoing it would be Jack Nicholson (Oscar winner)in the Shining.  He'll even admit it.  I think these days people are looking for reasons to hate any movie that is marginaly original.  Or even worse...when they see one, they get confused, then a little frightened and lash out at it.  "That movie outsmarted me! How dare it!?"  In this..the golden age of REMAKES, Saw was a brilliant whiff of originality.  Sure, comparisons could be drawn to a bunch of other films...but at least it's its own movie.  No remake of the 1976 "classic" here.<br />No fetch and borrow from some piece of Japanese crap either.  Think about that when you go see The Ring2.<br /><br />(edit and rebuttal)<br /><br />Ok, I can see that some of the other reviewers failed to understand what I meant when I said that they don't know how someone would act in the situation Cary Elwes' character was in.<br /><br />While I admit I've never seen anyone who's been locked in a subterrainian bathroom and held hostage while his family is being threatened....I do know how people act in situations where their families are threatened and they are powerless to do anything about it.  I work in a hospital where people who've been in fairly bad trauma situations come.  A recent example would be a pretty bad shooting spree in a church group meeting.<br /><br />Without going into details too much, the son/brother of a group of victims arrived at the hospital a while after the attack.  He lost his father and younger brother.  His mother was still in very critical condition.  While this isn't the same thing that happened to Cary in Saw, his reaction and behavior was almost the exact same thing.  Held back tears, and the look of someone who could vomit at any second.  I hate to get all depressing, but this is the best way I can think of to illustrate my point.  I'll agree that the other actors in the film may have given a sub standard performance, but Elwes did a fantastic job of portraying a helpless man whose family was in mortal danger.<br /><br />So while I've never been chased by robots with drills for gentials either, I do know the difference between ridiculus acting and a performance that is either misunderstood, or too real to be believed because its too unsettling.  I think because the scenario and performance of the others in this film requires a certain suspension of disbelief, his all too realistic portrayal may have seemed out of place.
What can I say about SAW other than the acting in this film was atrocious!  I mean, it was laughably bad.  The guy that plays Adam can't say anything without cracking me up.  And chubby Cary Elwes is the epitamy of pompousness, every word he says sounds forced as well.  I know the above sentences don't flow very well but I'm a bit pissed.  I had high hopes for this film and feel so wronged after finally having seen it.  The premise is very intriguing: two strangers wake up in a wickedly dirty bathroom, their feet chained to metal poles, or the wall (does it really matter, just know they were bound).  Throughout the course of the film Elwes says (with an air of righteousness) that they're probably in the clutches of the "Jigsaw Killer", a serial murderer that kills not so much physically but psychologically.  This concept fascinated me and I'm sorry to say it wasn't executed rightly at all.  Danny Glover stars in his worst role since Predator 2 and adds even more insult to injury as the obsessed detective stopping at nothing to find this horrid killer.  Of course there's plot twists abound, all involving the identity of the killer and a (I have to say) greatly executed sequence involving one of the only survivors of the killer that was really the highlight of the film.  The first viewing of this film left me stunned at what had occurred but after further thought i know why i was stunned: the ending is preposterous, a point which is generally okay in horror films but not okay in a gore hound's wet dream masquerading as a horror film that masquerades as a thriller.  Anyone not likely to catch the idiocy that the ending carries and not likely to care about the bad BAD acting this film is for you.  And, of course, gore-hounds are in for a treat after Elwes puts the saws provided the two near the beginning to good use near the end.  Me, I don't want my hour and a half back.  I want this to be billed as a horror/comedy.  Laughing out loud at this film is very easy especially at the end when Adam screams in agony, pure gold.  I know it sounds awful but, I am saying this, watch this film and see for yourself.  Most love this movie and that's fine, it's an American Film, all gore, nothing to back it up, except an interesting premise that's shot all to hell by the bad acting and unbelievebly idiotic and/or unbelievable plot twists.
Two men wake up chained to pipes in a decrepit subterrenean chamber - left with them are instructions from the infamous serial killer known only as "Jigsaw" who wants one of them to shoot the other. They only have hours to do this and if they don't, they both die. Left with them in the room are two hack saws - too weak to cut through chains, but strong enough to cut through flesh and bone.<br /><br />If it wasn't for SEVEN then this movie wouldn't exist. It's a good psychological thriller only let down by some bad acting and crummy dialogue.
I have to say that I am very disappointed with the way Saw turned out. I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to come out and I was let down. For one the acting was horrible, the screen play wasn't great and it just wasn't scary, at all. The whole movie looked low budget, which it was, but they could have done a better job with it. The only redeeming things about the movie are the premise, which is great, and the ending, which had a twist. Other then that, not good, if you want to see it, wait till DVD, it not worth seeing in theaters, I'm sad to say.
A decade ago I used to watch my fair share of horror movies, but at some point I started to have trouble finding good films in this genre. This resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of horror productions I watched each year. I am happy to say that "Saw" was reminiscent of the good old times. This is a movie that has an electrifying pace, plenty of gore, thrills galore and a clever plot.<br /><br />It all starts with two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy, rusty and generally disgusting bathroom. Between the two, there is a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. The two prisoners are clueless as to what is going on, with Dr. Lawrence Gordon being by far the calmer of the two, and Adam freaking out. Of course, at this point we are asking ourselves, what does the kidnapper want? But we do not have to wait long, and soon enough, the games begin. Adam finds a tape in his pocket, and Lawrence finds not only a tape, but also a key and a bullet. You can probably guess, but just in case, let me tell you that the key does not work on the locks that are keeping them chained.<br /><br />The point of the game is that Lawrence has to manage to kill Adam by 6 pm, or the psycho will kill his wife and daughter. At that time, we also find out that Lawrence has been a suspect in previous murders by this killer. We then get a combination of flashbacks to previous events related to this case, and the ordeal the two men are going through.<br /><br />The previous cases show us a very creative and twisted individual, who does not really kill his victims, but makes them kill themselves. In these scenes you will get a high dose of gore, so this movie is not for people that are even a little bit squeamish. If you like horror films though, I guarantee that you will be entertained through the duration of this movie and that your nerves are going to be seriously tested. There is only one reason I did not give this movie five stars; the acting. Both, Whannell and Elwes, deliver sub par performances, with exaggerated facial expressions that do not fit the mood of the film. Everything else on this movie is right on target.
Now that the mask of SAW's killer has joined up with the masks of SCREAM and HALLOWEEN in our collective unconscious, it's maybe time to take an objective glance at James Wan's movie. I haven't had the time yet to see the two sequels but the original SAW is really excellent. Good actors, which is pretty rare in this kind of production, a smart screenplay that should please amateurs of whodunit and serial killers movies as well as hard-edged horror movies fans and not too many references to previous films or disguised borrowings even if the atmosphere of CUBE and SE7EN is tangible in a few scenes. In short, SAW is a movie not to be missed if you're a movie buff.<br /><br />A DVD zone your library
Saw with Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell is so good, so creative, and so brilliant. I thought this movie was gonna be stupid but to my surprise it's probably the most strongest horror film I have seen since Scream. The camera tricks are cool and modern, the film has this great dark green color to it, as it does in the sequel Saw II (just as good as the orginial). Yes this film is gory and bloody but it works to the point where the film is not unbearable to view. Make sure you watch for all the clues, Saw is the perfect horror flick, highly recommend it!
I was kind of surprised by this film in the sense that this doesn't fit into Hollywood's formula for making horror movies these days. Meaning that the system thinks that most horror fans have double digit IQ's. Then I found out that it was independently made, and it all made sense. It actually has a carefully orchestrated plot. It even builds up on a mental level and not just on a visual one. Of course, they're really are a lot of brain-dead horror fans out there who couldn't understand something as clever as this if the jigsaw killer made their life depend upon it. As far as the uncut version goes, I wouldn't waste your money on it unless you don't have a copy of it already in your collection. I don't know what insignificant detail that the MPAA made them cut out of this movie, because I didn't see it at all. Unless you're big into extras or an avid collector who can't resist that way cool bleeding cover.
SAW.<br /><br />First of all, let me get this out in my opening. This isn't my normally preferred style horror flick. I enjoy films ala Event Horizon or Hellraiser (I and II) much more.<br /><br />This movie does very well keeping you guessing. Not until the very end does it reveal its cards. For that it kept my attention from stem to stern.<br /><br />The style of the movie - some of the quick cuts and shifting around in the story. They did it well for what they were trying to go for. For that, I'm not critical. Its just not my favored way to tell a story. I understood the story with no problems. I'm just no fan of "flashback" sequences when they are overused.<br /><br />The writers do a good job playing on our fears of confinement.  That dirty, nasty bathroom was a perfect scene to augment those fears.<br /><br />Overall, its a decent movie. A creative style killer who doesn't kill you, but mindf*cks you forcing you to do something that sickens you to live - I found that refreshing. The ending is most definetly not a "feel good" type either. For that it wins points too. I hate cliche endings that are too safe.<br /><br />My only knocks against it story could be bit jarring the way it was constructed. However, for its creativity and willingness not to cop for the crowd pleasing end. This one gets a rental recommendation from me.<br /><br />*** 1/2
This 2004 movie has a very unique premise:  Jigsaw, the film's "killer", doesn't actually kill his victims; he puts them in situations where they're forced to fight for their lives.  I thought that made this much more enjoyable than your standard "slash `em up" fare.<br /><br />The actual killing scenes also brought this up a few notches from your traditional "modern" horror movie.  Each scenario was ingenuous and very suspenseful.  They were also quite gory, but not in a gratuitous sense.  If anything, it added realism and made each of the scenes raw and disturbing in a surprisingly entertaining way.<br /><br />The only thing that brought this film down was the pace.  It seemed like the action dragged in a few places, especially when it came to the police's pursuit of Jigsaw.  It didn't hurt the film in the long run, though, especially when everything comes together for the surprise ending, which is bound to shock even the most seasoned horror fan.<br /><br />This is how horror should be done.  Highly recommended.
This movie is one of the best [Maybe the best] horror film from 2004. A demented killer who goes by the name of the jigsaw killer, Traps his victims [People who take their lives for granted] in difficult-to-escape death traps. His latest victims, A doctor [Cary Elwes] and a young man named Adam [Leigh Wannell, Who also is the screenwriter for this film] are trapped together in a mysterious run-down bathroom. Both of the guys are trapped in chains and are unable to leave. When they realize they've become the latest victims of the jigsaw killer, All hell breaks loose... This is a wonderful horror film that i would reccomend to all horror fans. This movie certainly has to be the best horror film that's been released in the 2000's so far. And, To top things off, This movie even has a clever ending that you'll never see coming. The plot is excellent, The acting is good, and The movie is actually more than just a whole bunch of murder scenes. Danny Glover [Showing up here as a former cop who lost his partner who's still in pursuit of the jigsaw killer out of vengeance] Turns in a good performance in this movie. If we had more horror films like this nowadays, The horror genre would be in great shape right now. Followed by a sequel, Which'll hit theatres this friday. Hope my review helped. Have a nice day, Be blessed. There is now an unrated version of this movie out right now.
In terms of its ability to scare and disturb, "Saw" is an A+ film. It's extremely raw and gritty, full of suspense, and contains some seriously disturbing subject matter and several now-infamous scenes of intense terror. However, there are several glaring flaws in this film as well. The script, while clever in some ways, could use reworking and polishing. A lot of the story feels sort of thrown together. Also, there are couple of performances that feel a bit amateur and over-the-top, namely that of Leigh Whannell. A little restraint can go a long way! James Wan is clearly a very talented director, but his direction of "Saw" feels at times a bit unrestrained or in need of some tweeking (much like the above mentioned elements) But despite these problems, "Saw" is one hell of an adrenaline rush to watch, and should please the most hardcore of horror fans. (FYI: there's not quite as much gore in this film as its reputation would lead you to believe, so, gore hounds, don't get too excited)
Why? That is my question. Why did they have to take a perfectly good horror film and tack on an arbitrary twist at the end that negates everything that went before it. Why? Saw had so much promise all throughout, and, if done right, the ending could have tied it all together and really delivered a message, but instead, the ending essentially throws everything out the window in favor of tricking the audience. Sure, all of the self-contained plot elements might make sense, but the resolution completely ignores all logical character motivations. This is not to say that Saw isn't a disturbingly scary movie for most of its length, but, jeez, why?<br /><br />The film opens in a disgusting bathroom that you can almost smell through the screen, where Adam (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay) and Lawrence (Cary Elwes) wake up to find themselves chained at the foot on opposite sides of the room, and, oh, there's a dead man lying in between them. They quickly intuit that this is not good, and Lawrence, a doctor, conveniently has a good idea of who has captured them here, because he was once a suspect. It seems there is a serial killer on the loose, but this killer does not technically do any killing himself; he cleverly finds ways to allow his prey to kill themselves.<br /><br />And so the killer has given Lawrence an ultimatum: kill Adam before six o'clock, or the doctor's wife and young daughter will be killed. The killer has left certain objects in strategic places for the two of them to discover and use as they will, including a jigsaw for each of them--not to cut off their chains, mind you, but rather their feet. Obviously both of them are freaked out. Along the way, we get some flashbacks involving Detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung) in pursuit of the killer. And there we have the setup: will Lawrence and Adam find a way to escape to save the lives of loved ones, or will Lawrence give in and kill Adam first? After all, he's got all the tools he needs at his disposal. But, wait, why are they there in the first place? And who is this killer who has brought them here?<br /><br />A film like Saw is more frustrating than your average run-of-the-mill bad horror movie, which is not to say that this is a bad horror movie; in fact, it's quite good. A bad horror movie is preposterous from the first frame to the last, and believe me, there are more of these kinds of movies than the world needs. However, Saw gives us an entirely credible premise, and fills it with just enough elements to keep our heads from spinning off, but then takes a horrible wrong turn and the wheels come flying off, leaving some viewers to think it's a brilliant twist that brings everything together when really it's a cop out, and offers nothing deeper than a "gotcha!" moment.<br /><br />Director James Wan has infused the film with a lot of style, using washed-out colors and quick edits to give it a gritty look and keep the suspense factor high. He also succeeds in using psychological suspense rather than monsters and one-off spooks. There are some truly terrifying moments where you know something bad is going to go down, but you don't know the what, when or who. All of the good points had me thinking that Saw would find a way to rise above the mediocre formulas of horror films, but the ending--oh, the ending!--still has me asking why, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Note: All of this talk and I haven't even mentioned the blood, gore guts, and violence that is depicted in this film. It is ample, I will tell you that. Saw is not suitable for children, and there are plenty of adults who will want to avert their eyes at some points as well.
When this movie came out in the movie theatre's I didn't see it because of my stupid friends who told me it was boring. So I decided to wait for it on dvd and I rent it at first and it was great almost every part was great so I decided to buy it and so should you there are plenty of gory parts and puzzels for you to figure out who the killer is and By the way I won't listen to my friends again because they never know what there talking about.
So many people have dissed this film because of the "bad acting," and "excessive gore." Well, maybe it is because I'm a dumb horror fan who is used to the so called "bad acting," but I really liked this film!<br /><br />Don't listen to those neanderthal whiners, the acting is fine, and it was not as gory as I expected, but did have some great bloody scenes, as it should! When you pick up a case that has a sawed off limb on it, then expect to see some carnage...morons.<br /><br />I'd catagorize this more as a psychological thriller. It starts off with a doctor and a freelance photographer, who are chained in a bathroom, on opposite ends. Between them is a dead body holding a gun and a tape recorder. In each of the mens' pockets is a micro tape with instructions on it. Through the dialouge, the viewer picks up on the fact that there is more to these men than meets the eye.<br /><br />Won't say more about the plot, you need to just go into this without any semi-spoilers. GREAT ENDING!<br /><br />From one horror fan to another, check this puppy out!
A well thought out little horror story with a great look for the budget and timeframe in which it was shot.......... the only negative drawback ?<br /><br />The 2 actors.<br /><br />Whenever the movie reaches a point where the terror/tension is reaching a peak, the 2 actors come across as comical and humorous instead of scared and terrified.<br />One gets the impression the 2 main actors kept laughing while doing the most horrifying scenes and the director/editor had to finally give up and splice together the scenes where they seemed to be cracking up the least.<br /><br />My wife for example kept asking me.... "Do you think they wanted this to be dark humor or something ?"<br />I replied "No.. the actors are trying to act extremely terrified, they just can't pull it off and come across like they are doing a spoof"<br /><br />If you overlook those acting ability limitations...the whole film as a package is well done.<br /><br />At least I stayed awake thru this film unlike the horribly boring and overated "GRUDGE", which I have no idea how anybody finds interesting.
...to make a film more horrifying and gripping than it actually is. First off, let's get something straight. Saw is NOT a horror film. It's a thriller. Horror films, by definition, involve the supernatural. Everyone got that clear?<br /><br />As far as the movie itself, Yes, it's bloody and a little shocking here and there, but as a whole, Saw is as lukewarm as the water in the tub. That the plot is a piece of Swiss cheese is secondary. The movie's biggest problem is the acting. Both Whannell (who should really stick to writing and let attempting to act go) and Elwes shamefully overact, chewing scenery almost non-stop. Even more maddening, when Elwes stops chewing, he underacts, as if he's reading from a cue card. He was always an average actor at best, and pretty much destroys any credibility he ever had here. Danny Glover looks like someone drugged him to do the film. The worst performance I've ever seen him turn in. And, a lot of the rest of the cast is mediocre, too. As far as the story goes, well... it's a movie. The problem is, if Wan and Whannell (sounds like a comedy team) would've tried to make the screenplay smoother, and Wan himself stopped trying to be so damn "I went to film school" artistic with all the unnecessary (they add exactly zero to the film) speed-ups and weird angles, this might've been a far more shocking and engrossing film. As it stands, far too may holes and unexplained or undeveloped areas. Overall, it's just weak. Finally,in a movie like this, when one of the major premises is gore, why not go for the whole thing instead of cutting away? Yet another example of a potentially terrifying,lasting film botched by poor handling. Makes you wonder what another director and writer might have done with it. Let someone who knows how to see Saw. See?<br /><br />PS: For those folks who considered this "gripping," "terrifying,"<br />Intense" or, God help us all, "award-winning," you really need to see more movies made before 2000. That's not being condescending, but truthful. If Saw represents a great film to you, you haven't had nearly enough exposure to the medium.<br /><br />PPS: be aware that a lot of reviews give away key scenes and/or the ending.
Anyone that says this was a dissapointing of stupid movie just wasn't able to keep up with it or not true fans of the genre.  This was without a doubt the best suspence movie since Seven.  It was filled with twists and turns that kept everyone guessing.  And even if you find the movie somewhat difficult to follow (which can happen if your really not into the movie or have to miss a scene) the end of the movie is WELL worth the wait!!
This movie is awesome, but very graphic. I think the title 'Saw' does not really fit the movie. A saw does play a very large part, but the title does not really show the great quality of the movie. If the rating system could go any higher, it would be higher. 6/5 and I think I found a new favorite movie.
I am a fan of Saw. Some say "gore-porn", some say original indi thriller. This 2 disc DVD edition is a great own for a collector of film and saw fans alike. I gave this 4 out of 5 due ONLY to the fact that the case itself is easily breakable. Like Saw? Do you buy every movie you see? This is a great addition to your collection... just don't drop it.
The Unrated Two-disk Special Edition of Saw contains an oil-filled packet (intended to resemble oozing blood) in the front cover of the DVD container.  I purchased a used copy which was shipped in this original packaging.  On arrival, some of the oil had leaked from the packet and made the DVDs unplayable.  I was able to wash and use the disks but I had to discard the fancy package.
Ever since this movie came out, I have heard people talking about how good it is so I finally decided to watch it! This movie really did the trick of catching my interest!<br />  The movie starts out with Dr. Gordon and Adam waking up in a dirty old bathroom and chained to pipes in opposite corners, with a dead man holding a pistol laying in-between them! After finding tapes in there pocket and receiving instructions on how they can get out, they must unravel the clues and escape!<br />  One of the best horror thriller movies I have ever seen I can't wait for Saw 2 to come out! I wan to play a game!
It's good to know they really know what to do with those halloween body parts.
This is probably the best one of the series.<br /><br />It's a very gory and realistic movie in terms of visuals. It will make your stomach turn and your hand will cover your face in shock and disgust.
I've only seen the first four...so far, honestly I didn't have an interest in this series until I started it, after months of people trying to get me to give it a shot. Let me say, color me impressed, this isn't your typical slasher series. Tobin Bell does a very creepy charecter, but he's a demented genius concerning what he thinks of in the series. This makes SCREAM look like Disney, I only have two complaints-the violence is very graphic, and doing 8 parts maybe overkill, no pun intended. However, I do look forward to the rest of them. A word of caution though, the images in these films will Not leave your mind easily, they could also cause nausea for anyone with a weak stomache, so if that's the case you may want to avoid them...like a disease.<br /><br />August 08,2010<br /><br />I've seen the whole series at least 4 times as of recent. I also recently purchased/watched the 2-disc uncut edition. Let me start by saying the uncut is not much different than the theatrical version-the twist never fails me either. The special features are plentiful unlike the first DVD edition. I do feel that Lionsgate should've retained the traditional clear case/dust cover treatment with the 2-disc. Are there any added scenes with the uncut version? Not really, dialogue is a little different in the end scene, but it doesn't ruin the story, I don't have the blu-ray edition yet but that may change. The plot of the whole series (to me, at least) is alot more impressive<br />than I ever expected, in part one-the game per se, involves two men shackled in an abandoned restroom and they're trying to figure out how and why they are there, the twist at the end makes my jaw drop every time.
When Saw became a hit out of nowhere in 2004 nobody expected it to become a successful franchise with numerous sequels. After all with its cheap 1.2 million budget you wouldn't think it would be possible for Saw to be the highest grossing franchise in horror history. Saw is labeled as horror but it's much more complex than that, there's a lot of psychology involved. For instance the main character John Kramer, known as Jigsaw because he removes a puzzle piece from the skin of his victims, is labeled as a serial killer but it goes deeper than that. Jigsaw chooses his victims very carefully, he selects persons because 1) they don't appreciate life or 2) they've done something really wrong. He is testing their will to live trough his "games" which are traps that often necessitate the victims to lose a body part or to go to extremes. You see, Jigsaw's goal is not to kill but rather to have the survivors enjoy life; it's a therapy he made. Saw puts photographer Adam and Doctor Lawrence in a disuse industrial bathroom both with their ankle chained, I the plot is now known enough that I don't need to explain what happens next.<br /><br />Saw became a phenomenon and in my opinion is one the best horror movie of the 2000s decade; it gave the horror genre a boost and inspired other movies. Whatever people may think about some of the sequels, the original one remains a great film and I think it's one of the best horror movies made.
Initially I will admit that I had no desire whatsoever to watch 'Saw'. My expectations were that it was going to be nothing more than just another one of those splatter films whose sole aim was to nauseate and repulse the audience.<br /><br />Miracle of miracles, I happened to be wrong. While the gore element is there, for the most part it is an anticipated horror more than an actually realized one (at least by today's standards). For most of the film the terror and dread is psychological in nature and proceeds from an intelligent storyline and a thought-provoking script which dialogues with the audience on such concerns as the nature of life, death and what a person would be willing to do to retain ones life.<br /><br />For me what really makes the film work is the protagonist nicknamed Jigsaw. While his actions are indeed horrific and grotesque his reasoning comes across as rational, his goals subtle and his attention to detail flawless. Well worth a watch, or two.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.
The whole series is very, very gory, but at the same time has a very plausible plot line.  Definitely falls within the "Psychological Thriller/Horror" genre.  Plus, it has the cute Cary Elwes of "The Princess Bride" one of my favorite movies.
At the time I watched this it was unlike a lot of horror movies that are out there. In fact it was better because it wasn't about going around and killing people with knifes this movie really messed with your mind, maybe you think because of all the twist and turns and was more of a sadistic killing then stabbing people. I really like this saw movie it ranks up there for me it's better than 3 for sure and I feel its tired with the fourth one. People will downgrade the movie now and saw it can get boring but these are the same people that were praising it when it came out. I believe the directors put a lot of time in the storyline and they were more active then the first movie. But this movie set the foundation for the saw series. It no dought I believe is helping save horror movies in the sense that it is bringing in a lot of money and the movie had a low budget. In the end this is a solid movie and you definitely have to pick it up most places you can find it for $6.99 a 4 star DVD for me.
As someone who HATES horror movies I was very happy to find this as being much more of a psychological, though still gory, movie.  I watched this when it first came out (being dragged there by a boyfriend of course) and was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this~ The biggest reason I am such a fan of this film is because for pretty much every movie or TV show I have ever seen I am able to see/guess what is happening next, but the ending to this movie was a huge surprise to me, and that alone, in my opinion, makes this a movie worth seeing.<br /><br />Definitively not your normal horror type movie.... more low key though many times at the edge of your seat, and being more psychological it really gets you thinking and guessing.  After all, the main point of this "Killer" is to not kill them directly but make them kill each other/themselves, and in many ways the Killer is the true, though twisted, definition of a Vigilante since the only victims are people that were deemed unmoral, etc.<br /><br />I think that people who like shows such as CSI will enjoy this movie very much, and the gore level isn't too much higher (for the most part) then the gore in those types of shows.  If you are uncomfortable about even that level of gore, or overall dislike psychological thrillers, then this movie is not for you.<br /><br />I do highly recommend this movie, but all of the sequels (at least the first 2, I stopped after that... though I did see some of the 3rd) are god-awful... going back to more of the regular "horror movie" type of lame and cheap scare/lots of gore.... a HUGE disappointment after seeing the first.<br /><br />(as a completely random side note, I have always loved Cary Elwes, especially in "The Princess Bride" so it was interesting seeing him doing a movie like this... though it was sad seeing him as a chubby middle-aged guy... but... it happens I guess, lol)
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN SAW 4 AND 5 IS A CHEAP ER DEAL AND SAW 3.
If you haven't seen the original Saw you really should try. If you are a horror fan, and you haven't seen this, you should be smacked with a copy of this disc and shamed. Even if horror's not your thing, don't judge a book by it's cover. Yes, there are some very graphic scenes captured on film here, however the story is one of the most original. If you liked Cube and the originality and level of tone this is right up your alley. The filmmakers assembled an excellent cast that completely sell the idea. This is not the PG-13 Japanese remake after remake stuff that has over saturated the market in recent years. This is a good psychological horror film with some very graphic elements.<br /><br />The Blu Ray version of this film improves upon the DVD rather dramatically. Capturing all of the beautiful yet dirty and grimey set design. The 6.1 & 5.1 audio tracks are used to their full advantage really giving this film as much mood and dimension as the cinematography. From the annoying humming of lighting fixtures to the intense score, it is probably one of the better atmospheric creations for a surround sound experience that doesn't feature the typical action fare of gun shots and explosions continuously and exhaustingly.<br /><br />Lionsgate has been one of the original supporters and most reliable makers of Blu Ray discs to date. Their BR discs are consistently some of the finest available for picture and sound. I would love to see Cube 1 & 2 amongst others in the catalogue of similar nature on BR.
I saw this movie a few years ago, and I remember it very well. This is actually a very impressive thriller. It contains lots of high tension, severe gore, and clever plot twists. The actors have done splendid jobs, and the writing is crisp and not too complex. Music is also fantastic, and the cinematography is to die for. I give this an A.
The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Saw begins promisingly by thrusting the viewer into a dirty basement with the two main characters, but quickly builds up so many plot holes that a good deal of the sequels' running lengths are devoted to clearing them up; if you like your horror leavened awful acting and nonsensical plotting, by all means check out Saw.
This movie was creepy, shocking, and finally, gross.  It was ok..However, although there are other SAWs out there, for me, one was enough.
"Saw" is one of those movies that divides its viewers straight down the line in opinions. You either love it or hate it. Most people that dislike it will say because it's too gruesome and twisted for them. That's understandable, because "Saw" is one of the definitive in the infamous but small, "torture horror" subgenre. So that explains why people would dislike it, but what about the people that like it?<br />Well I, for one, loved this movie, and here's why: "Saw" is not just a movie about people getting thrown in a room and slicing their legs off with giant blades or else their friends will get decapitated. No, "Saw" is actually a lot more than just a "torture" horror film.<br />If you manage to look past the gruesome violence of this movie, what lies beneath is actually a very intelligent crime film, like a really good episode of "Law and Order" or "NYPD Blue", just with harsher graphic content.<br />This movie also shows us the villain's ideals. It tries to convince us that Jigsaw, the villain of the movie, is actually not a serial killer and just goes about showing people the value of life in his own, twisted way.<br />A lot of the movie is also a flashback to the police-story behind it, whereas the present in the movie takes places where two guys are chained down and locked into a room, set to a timer.<br />This "Saw" is actually a little less graphic than any of its following sequels, save for a gory headshot and sawing through your own ankle. But what this movie lacks in the heavier gore of its sequels, it makes up for in its exciting suspense and smart film-making.<br />Overall, "Saw" is one of those movies that you have to give a chance before you decide whether you like it or not. I'm sure glad I gave it a chance, because it showed me that rumors and popular talk can trick you into thinking whether or not a movie is good, or something like that.<br />But anyway, if you want a great horror movie, mixed in with some crime and thriller elements, give this a shot. You may just end up loving it. Thanks for the time, and peace.
We heard about this movie and ordered it to watch on Halloween. Our plans was to pop some popcorn and watch Saw. Forget about eating while watching this show. If you like bloody shows with body parts cut off you will love this movie. Myself I don't care for it.
I really loved this movie, very intelligent and clever.  Not for the squemish.  It looks fantasic in blu ray
This is the best of the Saw movies by a long chalk. It's gripping and twisted, with some great shocks in it and a very good hold on the viewer. It's gory & it's got some very good surprises in it, as well as setting the audience up for one surprise after another. An excellent film.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a>
I just finished watching Saw and thought it was a great movie.  maybe I need to watch it a second time, but my question is are we to assume Dr. Gordon was killed by saw and Adam never rescued?
From an admittedly gruesome but purely artistic viewpoint, this first Saw movie is the only 5 star and by far the best film of the series.  Sure, the premise is a bit far-fetched and unlikely, but a good movie can ask you to believe the unbelievable, if it's well made.  If movies did nothing more than reflect our everyday mundane lives, there would be no reason to escape to the theater to bury ourselves in fantasy.  But if that fantasy just so happens to include a little carnage and gratuitous violence to the point of inducing just the tiniest bit of innocent nausea, then grab a barf bag, smile and enjoy it!  I'm exaggerating now.  I'll spare the synopsis I'm sure you've seen about the two men chained to filthy bathroom pipes with a violent suicide victim between them.  Instead, I'll focus on what makes this a brilliant movie.  There is an actual premise to this movie, and an actual psychology as well.  It's difficult to imagine the main antagonist in this work, Jigsaw, could have the financial or mental (or any other necessary) resources to pull off the stunts in this movie.  But to imagine a nearly surrealistic vengeance in such an unlikely form of vigilanteism still holds a fascination for the average viewer with a typically human blood lust.  What Jigsaw does to his victims is a vengeance that we all wish at some point that we could take....and as Jigsaw says, "I never kill people, I merely gives them the means by which they either kill themselves or survive."  Of course, you should never try any of these stunts at home, kids...but there is a brutal realism, in the human emotions displayed by Jigsaw, and his victims.  His dream of 'helping people to appreciate the life that they too often take for granted' is taken too far to the extreme in this movie, and people should never go this far in real life, but in the fantasy of cinema, the sense of victimization of everyone involved is truly felt by the audience, even while watching someone inadvertantly slicing themselves open or hacking off a limb.  There is gruesome violence here.  There are blatant real emotions, self-preservation and testing of the human spirit in the extreme.  As always, this first movie opens and explains a premise, and all subsequent sequels destroy the beauty and carnage of the original...because with the explanations out of the way, parts 2-4 can focus on more special effects, violence and even less plausable violence scenarios.  This movie stands alone as a work of art...violent, bloody, grotesque art...but art none the less!  Parts 2-4 are good movies and a fun viewing experience, but this first movie keeps the human traps simple, more believable and less complex...leaving the complexities in the thin, flimsy study and testing of the fragile human spirit.  Sure, you can break a person emotionally, but if someone's going to kill him or hack off a limb, it's better to let him do it to himself!  This is a great movie!  An inspired, gruesome work of grotesque art!  Make a point to see it, but not if you have to chop off an arm or something!
My corny title is not just there to be funny in a stupid way, as it is also meant to convey to horror fans who have not seen SAW, thinking it to be another HOSTEL/HILLS HAVE EYES/any "let's torture young people for fun instead of trying to be, you know, scary" movie, that it's definitely worth their time. I have not seen SAW's sequels (though I liked this one enough to see the others), but I can say that this movie is more in the SE7EN kind of vein than the torture porn flicks we've been subjected to over the last few years. Yes, it is quite often gruesome, graphic, and disturbing, but it is all accredited to a very clever and darkly interesting premise.<br />We are introduced to our two protagonists (if they can be called that, as they have their vices) first, workaholic doctor Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and cocky youngster Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell), who awaken in a dark room resembling a larger version of a prison cell, each of them chained to pipes adjacent from each other. In the center is a dead body holding an unloaded gun with a gunshot wound to the head and a tape recorder. Adam and Lawrence each have tapes to be played on that recorder, on which a raspy voice, their captor, informs Lawrence that he must kill Adam by 6:00 that night, or he will kill Lawrence's wife and daughter. To further explain what could possibly be going on, Adam and Lawrence both tell certain stories about their past, leading to flashbacks where we are introduced to other key characters like policeman Det. David Tapp (Danny Glover) and his partner, Det. Steven Sing (Ken Leung), who are on the trail of the Jigsaw Killer, a sadistic serial killer who forces his victims to save their own lives through twisted puzzles and games. Lawrence believes this Jigsaw is their holder, and that Tapp believes Lawrence is somehow in cahoots with Jigsaw. More plot complications pile on top of each other, leading to the bloody, shocking finale, which whether you like it or not, is a doozy.<br />Writer Whannell and director James Wan, both newcomers, showcase a great confidence towards filmmaking, as Whannell's writing is very fluid and engrossing (I'm not saying he's David Mamet, but for someone not much older than college age he's very talented) and Wan's direction points toward a long future in filmmaking. Elwes should have won some sort of horror acting award or at least award for best desperate screaming and wailing (something I can't quite say for Whannell, a much better writer than he is an actor, though he's more than adequate in his role). I can't tell you if the sequels are able to have a nice psychological thriller along with the blood and guts, but this one has it and more.
This was defiantly the best of the SAW franchise, but they lacked on traps, the creativity wasn't ver great, as the SAWs go on, they get more and more creative. This is a must see for any horror movie fan.
This movie is a great mind games horror movie.<br />You have to have creativity to understand this movie.<br />Plus it's not the same old slasher movie.<br />I got to say slasher horror movies are old,<br />to me this was a good change of pace.<br />If you think this is stupid you haven't<br />seen "The Grudge 1 & 2"!!<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!
Not a review but a question. Does this work on UK Playstations as only SAW III is available on Region B for some reason?
I was really surprised by this movie. I waited to see it until part 3 came out. I just had it in my head that it would be stupid, so I never gave it a chance. I'm so glad I listened to my husband! I watched all three movies in one night and I was hooked! The plot is really difficult to explain without giving anything away, so I won't. I'll just tell you if you're into thrillers, horror, or mysteries, watch SAW!
This is the first and as far as im concerned the best of the Saw movies.  This movie is very original and the ways the writter has Jigsaw torture these people is cool and very disturbing.  Personally, I didn't see the twist at the end coming and was blown away, I think that is why this is my favorite of the Saw series.  Highly recommending, but be forewarned; it's demented.
Many people are either going to enjoy Saw or hate it, and both for the same reasons - those sick, twisted games you gotta play to shed blood (and usually more) to see how badly you want to live.  Not only did Saw raise the bar on horror, it practically started the whole "gore" horror sub-genre (thus leading to films like Hostel, and making it a rare find to not see a recent horror film focused more on gore than the classic horror scares.  Personally, I can't say I am in love with this film because of the gritty nature, but it is still scary entertainment to an extent nonetheless.  However, with questionable films such as these today, I still enjoy the pleasure of seeing if there is a positive message I can still hack out of this, and though it's certainly wrapped around in insanity, the message is clear - are you grateful to be alive?<br /><br />This is where Saw gets my praise for being very original.  It's certainly scary at times and packed with grit, but it also has a side of it that makes you think.  Kind of a mystery to be solved, and when the answer is revealed in the heightened climax, its quite rewarding cause no one could have ever seen it coming.  The story uses flashbacks and pieces them together like a puzzle up til the very end, and just when you thought you knew what the puzzle is going to look like, it turns out to be a whole other picture.  The traps in Saw also carry originality, putting people in near impossible situations to escape, but not impossible.  Our villain Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is no murderer, but he finds ways for people to kill themselves - which is usually the case.  The reason for the traps is explained as a game you must play (in Jigsaw's eyes) to test and see how much you desire life.  Generally those placed in the traps are not grateful to be alive, and these horrific games quickly put things in perspective.  Once you see these scenes, its enough to say "Yes I am grateful."<br /><br />The cast is an interesting mix for a horror film.  Danny Glover is probably the most famous actor associated with the film, but the script is somewhat limited for his role that any actor probably could have pulled it off.  Cary Elwes is also an interesting addition when I think back to his roles in Princess Bride and Men in Tights...his character is the main focus in this film and his acting may have been better suited in non-horror films.  Tobin Bell, while he gets very little screen-time as Jigsaw and even then he is usually wearing a cloak, he feels like a perfect cast (though I say this after watching the Saw sequals where he gets a lot more screentime). Tobin Bell is to Jigsaw like Anthony Hopkins is to Hannibal Lecter - you see the actor's face and that's the role he was born for.<br /><br />Overall, Saw brings a variety to a horror film, though really its much more than your basic horror film.  It focuses less on scares and more on what's truly scary - very disturbing scenarios that ask a simple question, and the mystery of events that is impossible to solve.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Horror/Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4
I'm not exactly sure why, but I hate to admit I liked this movie.  It was blood, guts and gore at its very best.  Halloween sets the standard in horror, as far as I'm concerned, and this is in no way on par with that movie, but it kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat.  It's a simple plot filled with a lot of elaborate killings scenes.  I liked it enough to rent two and three, and if a Saw four comes out, I'll rent it to.  If you like horror with gore, you can't miss this movie.
Back in 2004, Lion's Gate released an ultra low budget yet very inventive horror film that spawned one of the most profitable horror franchises in the past decade.  The original Saw draws inspiration from older slasher and exploitation films with some great ideas of it's own.  Two, seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell) wake up in chains with a hacksaw between them.  They both are caught in a game weaved by a serial killer called Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) who claims to have their families captive.  In the meantime, a desperate cop (Danny Glover) is on the killer's trail, and it's safe to say that no one gets out of this in one piece.  It took me a while to check out Saw, as I'm not very much into what's considered modern horror movies.  However, it was good to see a new age horror film that takes advantage of the genre by offering up gallons of blood and gore to go along with stomach churning set pieces.  If there's anything bad to say about Saw, it's that the acting is very wooden, there's plenty of leaps in logic, and the first is definitely the best.  All in all, if you've never seen the original Saw, it's better than you might think, and definitely worth checking out, particularly for older horror fans missing that bite that the horror films of years gone bye were infamous for.
i thought that it was going to be more bloody than the SAW movie was. It was or at least I didn't think it was. The only cool thing was the case that the movie came in. the front is like a bag of some sort with blood in it and a jigsaw that floats around. really cool. not sure if it's worth the exact money for this version of the dvd.
When I went to go see "Saw" late last night I was thinking "saw" as the past tense of see and not "saw" as the noun ("a hand or power tool or a machine used to cut hard material and equipped usually with a toothed blade or disk") or as the verb ("to cut with a saw").  What was I thinking?  "Saw" is in the Grand Guignol of "Seven" and "The Bone Cutter," and apparently had to make some last minute cuts to avoid getting saddled with a NC-17 rating.  That alone with give you an indication of what first time director James Wan and first time writer Leigh Whannell were going for in "Saw," even with only $1.2 million to make the film and 18 days to shoot it.<br /><br />Adam (Leigh Whannell), a young man, wakes up underwater in a dark room with a chain around his ankle.  He is not alone, and when the light come on he finds himself is what appears to be a long abandoned public restroom.  At the other end is Lawrence (Cary Elwes), who is also chained to a pipe.  On the floor in between them, out of their reach, is the corpse of a man who apparently killed himself with a gun.  In his hand is a tape recorder.  After becoming oriented to his strange surroundings, Adam discovers a plastic bag in his pocket, containing an envelope.  Inside is a key and a small cassette tape with the words "Play Me."  Let the game begin.<br /><br />Beyond that you really do not want to know that much about this before you see it, and given the dreck that passes for horror thrillers in recent years "Saw" is worth the seeing in the theater.  The last time I actually went to see a film in this genre in a theater was probably "Hannibal," and I have not had any reason to regret being selective in this regard.  However, this is not going to be a date movie, but one for hardcore fans of the genre who prefer their DVD editions to be the director's unrated cut of the film.  "Saw" is a film that works more in the world of horror films than it does in the real world, but that is certainly part for the genre at this point.<br /><br />The entire film does not take place in the abandoned restroom, although that is main arena.  Lawrence knows something about the "Jigsaw Killer," who has been constructing elaborate dances of death in which his victims have to try and save themselves.  Only one victim has survived to date (Shawnee Smith), so it is possible to get out of this alive, just extremely difficult and we are treated to a couple of examples of where it did not go as well.  Investigating the case are a couple of detectives, Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), and the chronology of the film gets skewed as the present and the past become confused.  The game also involves more than the two men chained to the wall, because Lawrence's wife, Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter, Diana (Makenzie Vega) are part of it as well.<br /><br />During the film's endgame things are moving fast enough that you probably will not be able to figure out how it will all play out even though "Saw" overplays the obvious red herring card.  The film pushes one of my least favorite buttons a couple of time, which is when somebody has a gun on the villain and does not blow them away.  If there is one thing we have learned from all of these movies it is that hesitating when you have the bad guy in your sights is never a good thing.  I especially go through the roof when a trained law enforcement officer is pointing the gun right at the killer and the killer still gets away (even Clarice Starling is guilty of this sin in "The Silence of the Lambs").  So there is some heavy handedness to Whannell's script that hopefully will be replaced by something more elegant when he and Wan make their recently announced "Saw 2" sequel for 2005.<br /><br />But "Saw" is not an elegant horror film, although Wan gets points for keeping the most horrific moment of the film off screen (even though the rationale is small budget and not true aesthetic choice, which makes me fearful for what will happen when Wan and Whannell have a much bigger budget for the sequel).  The "Jigsaw Killer" has a warped interest in having his victims better appreciate their lives, so getting out alive has to do not only with Lawrence and Adam solving the tasks they are given, but also with finding out some important things about each other.  The important thing here is that the film's final scene is pretty horrific, even if the film cheats a bit to get to that point, and that even when the screen goes dark and the credits start to roll, Whannell keeps the horror going.
With some of the PG-13 tripe coming out as horror nowadays, SAW is a refreshing step back into the good old days where horror meant blood, and blood meant horror.  No annoying harpies or pretty pictures of hell or tragically humanized vampires here, just an ingenious killer with an obscure motive.<br /><br />SAW dives right into the depths of the madness too, opening with our killer's current victims, two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy restroom, a body in the center clutching a cassette player and a handgun.  Each man is given a tape to play, which provides him with a nice dilemma to ponder during his captivity.  The background of the killer and the events leading up to the men's current situation unfolds nicely during narrated recollections and well-placed flashbacks, while the actual motive stays hidden underneath the obvious delight the killer derives from the simple pleasures of torture.<br /><br />Because SAW also brings to film an excellent `Whodunnit?', I am not going to elaborate on the storyline any further.  Suffice to say that Cary Elwes and Danny Glover give excellent performances (Elwes surprising me since I have only seen him in comedy roles), the photography is good, the killing methods tasty, the blood not really overdone but still dosed out well, and the plot sustainable.<br /><br />Lets face it fans, we don't go to horror movies to learn how to do decoupage, we go to get scared and grossed out.  SAW fulfills that primal hankering, leaving you to utter `blech' and `bravo' in the same troubled breath, and wondering what your punishment would be like under the careful ministrations of this psychopath.<br /><br />Aficionados of the genre are going to love SAW's mixture of gore, insanity, ingenious traps, and filth, while non-lover's of the theme should stick to `Sleepless In Seattle' and other such ilk.  SAW put the taste of terror and gore back in my mouth, something that has been lacking in some of the recent sugar-coated intruders into this bloody domain.  Enjoy!!
I'm a hard sell when it comes to horror/thriller type of flicks (even though I was pretty surprised on how much I enjoyed the 2003 version of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre').  And aside from 'Kill Bill' (1 or 2), I cannot remember the last time I was genuinely excited to see an upcoming movie - oh yeah, I can, 'Return of the Jedi' - OK then, so that puts this in perspective.<br /><br />The clever thing about 'Saw', is its primal simplicity in explaining the human condition.  That is, when push comes to shove, a person will do some unsettling things to stay alive (remember that poor SOB that was caught under a boulder in the Rockies a couple winters ago - and had to cut off his own arm with a friggin' credit card to free himself?!).  Now imagine you're in a similar siutation, BUT, you don't have to cut your own arm off - just some stranger.  The bitter pill goes down a little easier, huh?<br /><br />'Saw' if nothing else, is simple and unapologetic - and well it should be.  3 hour bio-pics like 'Ghandi' and 'Braveheart' need 20 richly developed characters and $100 million budgets - not horror movies.  Besides, a lot of great flicks have ridiculously pedestrian plot lines (remember 'Speed'?).  Moreover, if you took at least one social science class at college, 'Saw' is basically a grizzly 90+ minute version of Maslow's Experiment or the Prisoner's Dilemma (you may have to crack open a textbook to cite the reference).<br /><br />Brass Tax folks - you WILL say to yourself during the movie, "She's not gonna do what I think she's gonna do?"; or "Please, don't tell me what I think is coming next, is actually coming next!".  Either way, do yourself a favor and see it in the theater because 1) It may become a classic on the sub-genre; or better yet 2) It'll become a big cult film - and you'll earn bragging rights, 'cause you saw it BEFORE the hype.
SAW is a true horror classic no doubt about it.  Damn he {or she} who remakes this film...EVER.  In the world of gore-porn and endless remakes or "re-imaginations", {I have to say this ~ Rob Zombie is pathetic for "re-imagining" Halloween...thanks for trashing it Rob} SAW stands alone as a film that is sick, very disturbing, scary, intense, frightful, mentally numbing, thrilling, avante garde, theatrical, spontaneous, evil, and macabre! This is a film where the villains recorded voice is as disturbing as his actions..and the villain is not even revealed until the last minute of the film...literally the final scene.  The film cannot be compared to Se7en because we see most of the torture in the film and the villain takes up more time giving his monologue than Jigsaw's "Most people are so ungrateful to be alive...but not you...not anymore."<br /><br />Two men wake up in a grimy abandoned bathroom chained and unable to escape.  We see a dead man laying in the middle of the floor.  His tape recorder reveals the two men are part of a deadly "game" in which only one of them will survive...if he can find the primal instinct..the "will" to survive.  As the film progresses we learn about "Jigsaw" who tortures his "test subjects" in order to make them appreciate their lives they have apparently abused.  Jigsaw's "test subjects" include: Jeff a man who attempted suicide but failed, Amanda the drug addict, Adam the voyeur photographer and loser, and Dr. Gordon a doctor who neglects his wife and daughter.  Jigsaw makes them realize their blessings in his tortuous devices where the subject must maime his/her self or another to escape.<br /><br />The films gives us clues to the identity of Jigsaw, directing attention to the orderly called Mr. Hindel aka "Zepp"...or is the killer one of the men chained in the bathroom? Dr. Gordon? Adam? The film is a Hitchcockian mystery to figure out 'who is doing this...and why?' that draws you to an intense and disturbing {not to mention disgusting} climax that will leave you stunned.<br /><br />I like the film because like Se7en there is a sick twisted pathos that is plain and painfully clear in our times:  "most people are so ungrateful to be alive...."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419654047">The Curse of Aleister Crowley: Descent into Lies and Madness</a>
This has got to be one of the most frustrating movies that I've seen in a long time.  What mother would let a man put a gun to her child's head and then hesitate to kill him when she finally gets the gun in her possession?  I found myself yelling at her to shoot him a million times and I don't even have to tell you what happened next because it was far too predictable.  I was still angry after watching it because I know in real life that nobody could be so stupid.  There are far better suspense thrillers out there to watch and I'm upset that I had wasted my money on this one!
`Saw' is a delightful movie to review, as it is such a mix of both good and poor qualities that it is a challenge to weigh them against one another to see what comes out ahead. For the impatient, I will say that I think the two cancel one another out in weighing the overall quality of the movie; however, the interesting aspects make the movie worth seeing and buying, in spite of the negatives.<br /><br />The first and most important positive for a horror film is the visceral reaction of the viewer. Did the movie scare, frighten, or cause mad dashes to the bathroom to clean out soiled underpants? The answer to this question for me is a tentative yes, but only with regard to a single, minor character, where the movie played the `Aliens' / `The Exorcist' card which put a child at genuine risk, not the supernatural, kinda spooky, kinda neat type of menace of `Poltergeist'. So my score on this point is positive.<br /><br />A second important positive for a horror film is the inventiveness of the threat. `Halloween' scores big on this point with its creative minimalism of a psychopathic stalker with a blank, white mask. This is in strong contrast to a lot of more elaborate scare scenarios done up until `Halloween' was made, whereupon everyone copied John Carpenter's idea. Another prime example among `B' movies is '28 Days Later' which changes the rules about how zombies are expected to act. It doubles its impact by adding a twist to the behavior of a group of survivors which seems to be making a psychological statement not unlike the classic `Lord of the Flies' survivors novel. My favorite example from A list movies is the nature of the threat in `Alien'. The object lesson here is to be sure to hire a great graphic artist when you design your monsters.<br /><br />The seemingly most striking original element of `Saw' is the fact that the perp is not literally killing the victims himself, he is putting them in situations where they do things which leads to their killing themselves, or at least failing to find their way out of a trap before the trap is sprung and they are killed by the environment created by the perp. While this is the element of originality explicit in the movie, this story line may not be quite as original as the authors would have you believe. There is a strong similarity between the fate of the victims in `Saw' and the way in which the murders are done in `Seven'. In both cases, the scenario in which the vics die is connected to perceived past sins. And, the deaths in `Seven' are to some extent a result of the victims' own actions.<br /><br />The truly more original aspect of `Saw' is that it is laid out very much like an adventure video game, where progress or even survival is based on solving puzzles. Clues are doled out by a very stingy puzzle master and they are generally couched in riddles, so we double the fun by making one answer one puzzle to get the clues needed to solve the next puzzle. The frustration in seeing the nested puzzles, yet you are stuck at the first step. Reminds me of the frustration of trying to find my way into the Underground Empire in `Zork I'. I must also say that most of the perils created by the perp win points for originality. These add to the dangers to those among us with weak bowels.<br /><br />The biggest question for the audience is for how long does the filmmaker maintain the suspense for the viewer? The answers to some of the puzzles are evident to the audience long before they dawn on the characters, partly because the producers let the cat out of the bag for at least one major piece of business in their promotional material. The writer did manage to keep the identity of the ultimate perp hidden until the very end of the movie, largely by presenting us with a fairly transparent red herring that kept our attention diverted from the real puzzle master.<br /><br />Weighed against these positives is a rather serious list of negatives beginning with the question of whether the two main characters would really behave as they did in the movie if they were presented with their situation. I think the initial panic is real enough, but I think the writer does not give enough credit to the problem solving abilities of a normally intelligent person, and at least one of the two principals is a highly educated surgeon. I really suspect that with the tools at hand, the two principle vics would have been a lot more clever in being able to free at least one, so he could go get help. As evidence of this, I offer the resolution to a similar problem in Stephen King's novel `Gerald's Game'.<br /><br />If you resolve the improbabilities, you are left with some bad writing for the roles of the police detectives working this case, lead by Danny Glover. The glaring contrast between Glover in this movie and Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman in `Seven' makes my point better than anything else I can say. This is not Glover's fault, except in the fact that he decided to play this weak role to begin with. I am inclined to say that the movie would have been much better if the roles of Glover and his partner had been eliminated or minimized. The movie makers probably felt they needed the detectives' business to have someone to chase perps and take bullets from the potential perp and from booby traps, since the two main characters are trapped inside their own personal dungeon. The cops also introduce scenes from past perp scenes that fill out the way in that our perp works and thinks.<br /><br />The movie does not live up to its hype, but it is worth a good chill.
Ask anyone about `Saw' and you'll get the same answer. "It was like `Se7en' but not as good."<br /><br />`Saw' is only similar to `Se7en' in that they fall into the same genre of Serial Killer Thriller. But plot wise I'd compare it closer to `Usual Suspects.' Both stories are non linear. The plots are told from different points of view and through flashbacks, creating a very complex edge of your seat thriller.<br /><br />The plot: As you may already know, `Saw' begins with a GREAT narrative hook about two men, Lawrence and Adam whom wake up in a cellar bathroom chained to pipes. The men must think back to how they could possibly end up in such a predicament.<br /><br />The rest of the story is told by the men looking through their surroundings and finding objects their tormentor has left for them. Key words, and objects that end up taking shape in some way.<br /><br />The plot is also told via flashbacks by Lawrence. He remembers being a person of interest in the "Jigsaw" killings, in which the people were tormented in truly sick and original ways. (`Se7en') The police detective (Danny Glover) uncovered an extramarital affair by Lawrence but cleared him of the killings, and left both Lawrence and Glover totally perplexed as to why the Jigsaw killings took place or why the victims were chosen.<br /><br />This is the first hour of `Saw' and it's great. Chilling, well acted, and most importantly keeps you on the edge of your seat dying to know what will happen next.<br /><br />The last third of `Saw' goes WAY down the drain with new narrative hooks which have no objective or conclusion. Next we see Lawrence's wife (Monica Potter) and daughter held hostage at gunpoint in their apartment. We see Danny Glover go from hero cop to revenge driven nut after the death of his partner.<br /><br />Where was `Saw' going with these new narrative hooks? Nowhere! Sad to say but `Saw' ends with no conclusion as to whom lives or dies or what motives our characters had.<br /><br />The most infuriating thing about `Saw' is how after so much originality, it attempts to wrap things up with old cheesy movie formulas. Characters that kill each other by struggling for a gun and shooting themselves at the same time, and cops with guns so stupid as to not call for backup and then get close enough to the killer so that he can pull a knife.<br /><br />Spoiler Warning! Another pathetic last minute narrative hook is Adam's revelation that he knows Lawrence and was hired to follow him, and knows whom hired him. Not only does this blow the premise that Lawrence and Adam were strangers but shouldn't he have mentioned that right away?<br /><br />Spoiler Warning! Who lives or dies? Having argued with fans there seems to be some dispute. I conclude that if Lawrence lives so must Adam, because if Lawrence is able to successfully hop away, the police will return to the scene of the crime and rescue Adam. The Jigsaw killer locking him in the room is pointless since Adam will be rescued and he now knows the killer's identity.
First off let me say if you are a light hearted person this movie probably isn't for you.  The dvd itself has ok extra's.. it comes with 5 trailers and a music video. Now the movie is visually nice.  The story is pretty twisted and sick.. I am a huge horror fan but I have to say I was pretty disgusted watching this movie.. it has alot of torture scenes that will make your stomach turn and disturb your sleep if you are weak hearted. One of the things that makes this movie so disturbing is the fact that there are real life people that actually go through sort of the same chainings and torture that the charachters in the movie go through and that is very unsettling to think bout..  The acting I felt was ok.. it could have been done better.. the charachters don't show the emotion that you would expect a person to have under the cirumstances that they were in.. all in all I give this movie 5 stars because the plot is brilliant.. and the ending is soooooooooooooo unexpected that you'll find your self saying WOW once you see it.  Very .. very sick movie but a good one nevertheless.
Oh, what this movie could have been.  I don't think the directing or acting was that bad.  But the script was too generic.  A little research was needed.  Let me explain:<br /><br />#1. A doctor would never say he had been electrocuted because he knows what the word means!  It means you are dead.  The average person does say that when they are shocked; doctors NEVER do, ever.<br /><br />#2. Why would the good doctor use the saw (removing...well, I don't want to give anything away)when he could have used his shirt to reach the cell phone on the floor?<br /><br />#3.  The twist of the movie is not really a twist at all.  I don't want to give away the plot, but it doesn't hold up as being a "Wow, I never would have guessed that?" movie - if that is really what the author was shooting for.  The viewer was not given enough information to make the shock value come out.<br /><br />#4.  The detectives would have discussed the "other" evidence in the case: hundreds of feet of razor-wire, timing devices, the safe, the candles, etc.  Why did none of this material lead them to a purchase location?  This needed to be explained, because there has never been a killer, in the history of killers, who has left so much material behind.  He had to buy or steal this stuff from some place.  And some of the material was so unique, like the contraption he strapped to the one woman's head, that they would have to be able to trace the origins.<br /><br />#5  I was sickened by another film where a person who has just been terrorized by an EVIL person doesn't pull the trigger when the tables turn.  I've seen thirty years of that ridiculous scenario.  When will Hollywood learn how dumb that is.  I would have shot the guy in the forehead until his brains became artwork on the carpet.<br /><br />Okay, all that said, the movie did have some good acting and some really creepy scenes.  It is disgustingly horrific and a little interesting.  The film could have been so much more with a little more thought and research put into the script.  Ya can't blame this one on the acting.<br /><br />See ya next review.
I went to "see saw", simply because I am a huge elwes fan. I haven't always liked every film he's been apart of, but all in all he's very dependable. After reading the reviews of several critics and balancing whether or not I should spend the twenty bucks, I sauntered into the theater with low expectations. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Saw opens with two men in complete darkness. Only their voices are heard, as they figure out a way to turn the lights on. It takes a little courage to start a film this way. No explosions. No endless galaxies. Darkness and two voices. That drew me in pretty quickly. Then, once they take that step, the film begins.<br /><br />Saw is not perfect. Is any film? It has dozens of puzzles that unfold at exactly the time the plot deems it necessary. Yes, it feels sometimes forced. To me it felt like a train ride, you know its always going to go in one direction, but as long as you reach the destination, no one cares. I didn't. I just sat there, allowed the film to have its way with me, sipped my pibb, then walked away with a grin. It does touch on other films like se7en, which is sitting on my shelf right now, but if it wasn't made, would we still be bashing Saw? Also a key difference is in this we get to see the actual events, rather than the aftermaths. Also, you cannot guess the ending before it comes. Its near impossible. Yes, that's a challenge.<br /><br />I am going to conclude on this. I do recommend Saw, simply because it has managed to do something very few films have accomplished. It has a secret. A one million dollar budget. That is unheard of! It continues the trend of low-budget, independant films that are sweeping the globe in massive success. Saw has earned nearly 72 million dollars world wide. I say congratulations to all envolved, and cudos on making something out of nothing.
This movie is viewed on two separate levels: first, as a serial killer thriller and, second, as a psychological horror film. This movie achieves success in both areas, and is actually a really good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe. The one thing that I consistently say about this movie is that the NAME and Picture have caused many to never see this movie....  But, that is also one thing that is appealing about this flick<br /><br />The movie opens with two characters, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and nondescript young Joe-everyman Adam (Leigh Whannell), waking up in some dingy forgotten bathroom, chained to the walls with a dead body lying between them. Without completely running the storyline I will say that Saw definitely has some unique twists and clever fright scenes. Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere. The dank bathroom and the spooky interior settings make this movie very unsettling, while the more visceral horror works on a more psychological level.  Definitely a movie that I would watch in the dark....<br /><br />Despite any shortcomings that some may discuss, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience. The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.  If you want to watch a movie that makes you think while scaring the pants off you...watch this movie!
This film harkens back to the old days of horror films which were loaded with blood and good old-fashioned terror.  Many of today's horror films have left out much of the blood, but that is not the case with "Saw".<br /><br />Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) find themselves in a very dirty and unkept bathroom, each chained at opposite ends of the bathroom  to a pipe.  There is a dead man in the middle of the bathroom, lying in a pool of blood and clutching a tape recorder in one hand and a gun in the other.  After overcoming their initial shock, Lawrence and Adam decide that they must work together in order to get out alive. They begin to search the bathroom for anything that might help them escape, but the only items they find are two hacksaws that prove to be worthless in cutting through the chains that are holding each man to their respective pipes.  Each man discovers that they have a small cassette tape in their pockets.  After retrieving the cassette player from the dead man, Lawrence discovers that in order to survive, he must kill Adam before the clock on the wall reaches 6:00. Also, Lawrence finds out that his wife and daughter have been taken hostage, and they will be killed if Lawrence fails to kill Adam.  This sets off a desperate race against the clock to try to escape, as well as finding out the identity of their captor.  Will Lawrence and Adam survive?  Will Lawrence kill Adam?<br /><br />This movie is very good.  The plot is brilliantly conceived, and the twists and turns are definitely the highlight of the film.  A lot of good background information is provided in the flashbacks expreienced by Dr. Gordon.  The ending of the film was totally unexpected, and it will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The plot is extremely well conceived and the story is teriffic.  Watch this movie and try to guess what will happen next.
Saw is a mindblowing story that really gets your mind thnking, instead of just watching teenagers get slashed up by a masked killer.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys the horror genre and enjoys and critical thinking.
Okay, this was a flat out creepy movie. But, very brilliant!!!! The story is very simple and gets straight to the point. A killer named Jigsaw is bent on teaching his victims to appreciate what they have in life, the hard way!!!  Especially, two victims that are chained together in a rundown warehouse. Now, the two victims have to figure out their connection together or else. One of the victims can kiss their loved ones goodbye. Like I said, very creepy. But, good!!!!
This movie was a real mind trip to me!  I love these kinds of movies.  I, for one really cared about the characters which made it even better.  I wanted both of them to get out alive.  With all the CG **** out there now, this movie is a real treat!  It kept me interested, and I like the way it all unfolded.
I thought this was a very good movie.  It had a very morbid feel to it.  It also was probably was the only horror movie I have ever seen that tries to have a good message.  I have read some reviews that say they don't see the point of the movie.  Not many horror movies have points.  Any other bad reviews were probably just written because people were mad that they didn't see the ending coming.  It surprised the crap out of me.  I recommend this movie.  It's worth your time.
Two men wake up in a scuzzy and awful looking bathroom with chains and ankle bracelets on them attached to pipes. They dont know why they are there until they find 2 tapes and a recorder on a dead guy in the middle of the room. So, there's a sadistic loony killer called The Jigsaw Killer out there who loves to play games with his victims and has them play in dangerous scenarios involving barbwire, bear traps and fire. Soon. Doctor Gordon, played by Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Robin Hood Men In Tights) and the other man Adam, played by Leigh Whannell (Razor Eaters, Matrix Reloaded) ,find out why they are there....they find 2 saws and to get out they  cant saw threw the chains, but their legs to get loose. In the same vein as SEVEN. Who doesnt want to see Cary Elwes, Westley from Princess Bride, saw his foot off? That scene of superbly done, the music was just right and the ending was what got me...totally didnt see that coming. Also starring Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon movies), Tobin Bell (Black Mask 2, The Firm) Monica Potter (Tv's Boston Legal, Con Air), Benito Martinez (Tv's The Shield), Shawnee Smith (Saw 2, Tvs Becker), Dina Meyer (Saw 2, Starship Troopers) and Ken Leung (Rush Hour, Keeping The Faith). Dina Meyer and Shawnee Smith also star in Saw 2 as the same characters...Tobin Bell as well too
When it comes to horror movies, most of todays fare are mediocre at best.  They seem to center around a young adult ebing tormented by some unseen assailant in a goofy halloween mask.  And by the end of the flick you wonder why you invested that much of your life watching it.  Bad effects, lousy soundtracks and terrible acting seem to be the foundation to the majority of the lot lately.<br /><br />And then there is 'Saw'...<br /><br />The setting is excellent.  The old bathroom that comprises most of the movie's background is straight outta my nightmares.  It has excellent acting, and the soundtrack is perfect for the style and tone of the whole movie.  The best part being the ending(no spoilers here if you haven't seen it yet)...it catches ya by surprise to the point ya have to rewind it 5 times just to see how you missed it to begin with.<br /><br />I didn't want to go into detail too much for those who have not taken in this masterpiece of modern horror.<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting to see if 'Saw II' lives up to it's predecessor.  The voices in my blood say 'Yes'...

Some very creative moments with the suspense a very creepy looking clownlike doll on a toy bike and the surprise ending is the only thing that keep this at bay. The acting in here is subpar with Danny Glover (The Lethal Weapon Movies, Bopha!) wasted as a cop on the case, Monica Potter (Along Came A Spider, Head Over Heels) as Elwes' wife and Cary Elwes is so-so though he kinda gets ridiculous at the end where he saws threw his leg. Not for the squeamish and it's really dumb to see some scenes where they go into fast motion (example...car chase scene). Also starring Tobin Bell (THe Pelican Brief), Benito Martinez (TV'S The Shield) and Ken Leung (Rush Hour, AI:Artificial Intelligence).
While it may not break a lot of new ground, this is a movie that, at the very least, makes the viewer think more than do the majority of horror films.  For that alone, it deserves credit.<br /><br />An earlier reviewer mentioned, "The Usual Suspects," and I think that's a somewhat apt one to use.  This film has no lack of possibilities as to who could be the "Jigsaw Killer," and it really does keep you guessing until the end.  There are a number of violent scenes that I wouldn't recommend for anyone who may be squeamish, but the movie doesn't get by simply on its horror.<br /><br />As for the ending, it's definitely interesting.  Personally, I didn't see it coming, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Overall, this is a good film, one that I'd recommend even to those who aren't always enamored of horror.
This was recommended by my brother due to the fact he knows how I love great horror films. The storyline was very captivating and everything seems to fall into place as the storyline continues. Really not that graphic too, I like scary films but not too much gore..this had just enough to get the point across. Really creepy, I think you will like it..turn off the lights (if you dare-I couldn't), grab the popcorn and settle down for a spine tingling good time.
Ok...that was lame. I apologize. I really liked this movie. I won't repeat all the comments already posted, but this film reminded me of a cross between "Seven" and Vincenzo Natali's "Cube" (if you haven't seen Cube, I recommend that as well. But avoid the sequel and recent prequel!)<br /><br />The ending is just twisted enough to surprise, but not so out of left field, it leaves you wondering what you missed!
I always seem to disagree with the great concensus when it comes to movies.  If everybody hates it, I usually love it.  And vice versa.  I thought Saw was a very good movie.  I admit, it could've been done better, and at times, it kinda ran on, but overall, I really liked it.  Definitely one to see.  Perhaps not a buyer (sorry Amazon), but you should definitely check it out if you get the chance.
Okay, so it was made on the cheap but with SAW, director James Wan shows he's got what it takes to make his mark on Hollywood.  Oh yeah, and the $18 million opening weekend on a film that only cost about one million doesn't hurt either.  With SAW it isn't the nominal stars that matter, it is the STORY.  Credit an imaginative screenplay with plenty of reversals at the end.  Now I know why the production company is called Twisted Pictures, the movie twists and twists and twists.  A lot of people have called these plot developments implausible, I prefer creative.  With the success of SAW I bet we see the return of the antagonist-who by the way when revealed is truly creepy- in SAW N-2.  Jigsaw is destined to join Freddy, Jason and Michael Meyers in franchise heaven.
People, I agree it's not as good as Seven or Silence of the Lambs like they are comparing it to, but it is still a great film in it's own right.  I found it very interesting and it wasn't as gruesome as some are making it out to be.  At least for me anyway.  If you like thrillers than this is one you'll like.
in response to what the person above me said about protesting a second release, well thats fine and dandy but, if your smart like me, then you would of known that they were going to release a seperate special edition later on(like I suspected and didnt buy it when it came out and waited) instead of whinning about it. cause most people do that especially with popular movies or movies that are going to be a sequel or remake so keep this in mind next time. as for my review on the movie, its one of the most original horror films ive seen, great mixure of seven and silence of the lambs with a great twist. cant wait for the second one.
Creepy movie for sure but not creepy enough... The film begins out with promise and then falls apart miserably in the final 1/3 of the movie. The ridiculous sub-plot with Danny Glover was embarassing to watch. The 'who dunnit' becomes weak and fails as the writers seemingly ran out of ideas and just slapped together some mess of an ending. At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary - but in the end, the film falls short of its goal.
With the opening scene a mix of fear and panic, as two men realize they're both chained to pipes, with a dead man in the middle of a puplic sewer bathroom, it isnt long before... Before um...<br /><br />I watched this movie in the theatre, and again when it came out on DVD, i have no idea why i saw it again. For starters, why did they call it "saw" ? Did they think just because of a vague reference, they could get away with it? Well... According to a few reviews, apparently they did. But they didn't get by me.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a serial killer who throws puzzles at his victims in which case with a lot of luck, will power, and the will to live, they could get through. The premise is, he doesn't kill people, he just forces them to kill themselves... It isn't all that. Good premise, bad writing of it.<br /><br />First of all, I don't take much issue with the name so much, as I take issue with the sheer stupidity of the writer who came up with this thing. I'll give them one star for originality, and one star for good cosmetic effects, the rest just isn't there.<br /><br />For starters, from the way the storyline [if you can call it that] is given, you can tell an amateur wrote the script and therefore, they should have made the story a little better, or wrote it a little more believable.<br /><br />For instance, the hack saws the two men get [maybe that's why they called it saw]. They have six hours to live, and they give up sawing through the chains after ten seconds... Record time for stupidity. Ok, ill give the one who broke his a break, but the other one who remained calm, could have gotten out if he sawed instead of jabbered. This was a huge turn off for me, and thus, the rest was just a bit of mindless plot that seemed to just be added at the last minute. Almost as if they were making it up as they went along.<br /><br />Let's be realistic, if any intelligent human being were in that situation, sure, we'd be afraid, but with so much time and a hack saw [let alone a doctor who must have learned patience during his 10 years in school]... we wouldn't be so stupid as the two men were. Since most of the story revolves around them, I don't give any sympathy to the characters.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it had a few really cool scenes of people in hopeless situations, and a few jaw dropping views of solid gore, but once you got used to it... it wasn't anything special.<br /><br />If more thought went into this movie, and maybe they actually tried to make the name make sense, it might have been a good movie. But inevitably, since we're watching two morons talk to each other for 2/3s of the film...<br /><br />it is rather boring.
I had been told by a few people who had seen the movie that it was laughable and in no way frightening, yet other reviews here on Amazon seemed to speak from a different standpoint.  So, as a true fan of terror on film, I had to judge for myself.<br /><br />I found the plot to be quite creative and intriguing.  The scenarios Jigsaw stages are intricate, alarming and bizarre- leaving his victims to make terrifying choices in order to survive his "game".<br /><br />At the opening to this movie, you are thrown straight into the thick of things.  The movie begins with two men chained to pipes in a dilapidated room, with a dead man lying in the middle of the floor.  The story then slowly and deliberately begins to unravel, with each man ultimately learning why he is there.  Danny Glover is introduced soon after as an investigator on the Jigsaw case.  Cary Elwes surprised me in this role, showing a far darker side than he's ever before revealed on-screen.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful and interesting, with a good and somewhat startling ending.  It turned out to be far better than I was told it would be.  I'm glad I decided to see for myself.
OK! i'll be the 1st to say i wanted to see this movie more than anyone and me and about 8 friends went opening night all worked up into a frenzy over this supposidly horrorfying movie...it did absolutely NOTHING for me. It wasnt a total waste of the 8$ i spent to see it (the 2 scenes where the girl with long black hair came out of the guys car, and attacked him in the closet ((closely resembling the grudge)) were very good and the death scenes at the begining were good ((the barbed wire and glass)) yes, this movie had the potential to be something much more) i shuttered about 3 times and the rest of the time i found myself laughing at the total idiocity of this movie! This is one of the could have, would have, and should have movies...<br /><br />It wasnt THAT bad...but i dont plan on renting or owning it any time soon...
I just saw "SAW", the brilliant psychological horror film from director James Wan. Two men wake up in an obscure prison cell, one a doctor, the other a photographer. They are chained up, with no obvious chance to escape. They are a piece in the "Jigsaw" puzzle. They are part of a brutal "killer's" game, and they must find a way to win, and find out who plays the main role in their mysterious and vomit-inducing inprisonment.<br /><br />"Saw" succeeds on almost every level. It is gruesome, tense, and atmospherically terrifying. I cannot say enough good about this movie-you have to see it to believe it. No pathetically played-out jump scenes here. This is straight suspense, and everything you think is something IS something.<br /><br />Graphically nauseating, "Saw" manages to make its viewers terrified, but mostly intensely uncomfortable. Watching the Jigsaw's victims kill themself in trying to save themself is incredibly unpleasent and left me shaking. And while incredibly well-played out, I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The plot twists are numerous, and for once, they are significantly shocking. (Cellmates aren't always who they seem...) This movie is a jigsaw in itself, and Twisted Pictures development studio has left your brain wrecked, rattled, and well, twisted. You are not a viewer. You are a thread, slowly being woven around the finger of this film's makers.<br /><br />For a foray into the truly terrifying and morbidly uncomforting world of film, "Saw" is a must-see. "Jaws" kept you out of the water? This movie will keep you out of your SKIN for a few years. Just remember, nothing is what it seems in filmmaking. And the brilliant "Saw" only furthers this point. Sleep tight, and hope you wake up where you went to sleep the next morning.
This movie doesn't have much to offer. It's typical horror, psychological stuff that will either thrill you or leave you wondering why you even bothered to rent it. And one shock (which happens in the end) doesn't make up for a mediocre movie. The characters don't learn anything about themselves, the "killer's" (he's more like a puppermaster) motivation lacks depth, and his choice of victim is screwy with what motivation we do get. This movie is just, well, stale.<br /><br />So Adam and Lawrence wake up in a dirty bathroom, each chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room with a guy who has blown his head off laying between them. They don't remember how they got there, nor do they know why they of all people were so unfortunate as to end up in a smelly, disgusting bathroom. Lawrence thinks he knows who did it-- the same guy, known as the jigsaw killer, who had killed (or rather set up his victim's to kill themselves) several people. We learn that Lawrence was a suspect. Anything of importance about Adam, Lawrence, and the killer, are revealed in a series of flashbacks. It's a tad confusing, but it's all sorted out in the end. And the final shock is actually pretty good. I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />This movie is just under par in terms of character. I really want to see a horror movie that has a killer with awesome motivation and victims who use their heads instead of machetes to discover the mystery murderer. If Lawrence had thought about the situation a little more, he would've concluded that sawing his foot off (yes, he does that, and it's cringe-worthy) was a bad idea. Not a bad movie, not a good movie, just a typical Saturday night horror flick. Better than other horror films that have come out recently though. House of Wax, anyone?
Not since Reservoir Dogs have I been totally grossed out by such a movie. However I found the director's twisting back and forth between blood and gore to the mental insanity interesting. I found my concentration shifting back and forth between the two, keeping me guessing and wondering until the surprising ending. At the end of the movie I found myself thinking `I should have known all along!' but I didn't. The director keeps you firmly over-analyzing and slightly confused. The only thing I found lacking was the development of the Danny Glover character, I think it could have been developed a little more without hurting the movie. Great flick but NOT for the squeamish!
As SAW opens, two men awaken to find themselves chained in a filthy industrial bathroom without any memory of how they got there.  One is given the instruction that by a certain time, he must kill the other man or his family will die instead.<br /><br />We soon discover that the scenario is the work of a serial killer known as `Jigsaw,' whose M.O. is to place people in sadistic set pieces from which escape is possible, but at great cost.  Like the killer in SEVEN, Jigsaw is trying to teach a lesson.  He targets individuals who don't seem to appreciate their lives.  But unlike `John Doe's victims, Jigsaw's have a way out available to them, horrific though it might be.  The sole survivor of his traps emerges a changed woman and claims "he helped me."  This is an interesting point that I wish had been given more attention.<br /><br />SAW is a gripping, suspenseful and unpredictable thriller while it's running.  It wasn't until I thought about it afterward that I realized it just didn't make sense.  The plot of the film - at best - relies on the remotest of coincidence to play out, while many of its elements don't work altogether.  In the manner of Dario Argento, the filmmakers went for style and effect rather than logic.  I'm willing to overlook it in this case because I was thoroughly entertained for the duration.<br /><br />For the benefit of the timid, it is perhaps worth mentioning that the film is not as grisly as its subject matter and promotional imagery would suggest.<br /><br />The DVD of SAW includes commentary by director James Wan and writer/actor Leigh Wannell.  It is fairly interesting and often funny.  There are two music videos for Fear Factory's "Bite the Hand That Bleeds You" - one rated and one unrated.  The rated one is actually better.  The unrated video requires the band and a model to act (badly) while singing the song and is kind of embarassing.  There is a "making of" featurette for the unrated video, as well as a very brief one for the film itself.  Finally, there are trailers and poster art.
I was told by one of my friends that this film was ''the best movie ever''. Now , because my friend is one of the most intelligent people i know , i thought to myself ''wow , this must be really good...'' , so i went out and watched it. Well , at first it started off promisingly enough  , a gritty , disturbing scene with 2 men in a hellish situation. From there it goes quite well , suspense and mystery build up reasonably , and the viewer sits there in awe wondering about how the men will get out of the situation they are in , and who is the person responsible. However , things begin to get lame as the finale gets closer , and then finally , there's the famous ''Twist''. This ''twist''is actually the dumbest twist i have seen im a movie for as long as i can remember. Forget comapring it to the twist in ''The 6th sense'' , its not even in the same league. I read another review that compares ''Saw'' to the masterful and classy ''Audition'' , sorry to say , but that comparison is ridiculous. All i say is this , when the ''twist'' happens , just think to yourself , ''How?''. Once that question is asked , the film falls apart. And im not talking about the doctor either , im talking about all the other victims. How on earth did the killer find them? How did he get their details ? Was it that the killer just picked people at random and then they just happened to be people that wasted their lives? For the killer to pick them , he would have had to research them . How did he research them?? Seriously , c'mon , dont even try to say that its a horror film and that plot holes dont matter , because they do. This film is nowhere near as good as people make it out to be. Its amateurish at best , and the twist is pathetic.<br /><br />Its really a waste of time.
This movie scared the living daylights out of me.  The bad guy was so twisted and evil that I won't forget him for a while.  I felt the acting was quite good also.  The premise of waking up and finding yourself chained up with no memory of how you got there kind of reminded me of Cube, which is another great film if you haven't seen it.
I have never written a review before, but given the recent group of horror/thriller movies, so called anyway, I was compelled to speak my mind.  I am a horror movie fan, have been for as long as I can remember, love the dark horror to the more cult type hits.  Anyway, SAW is not for everyone, especially those expecting to be scared or disturbed.  Mind you, there were some scenes to will disturb if you are easily disturbed, but in all it was not a major step forward in the horror/thriller genre.  If you have seen SEVEN then you have seen SAW!  Plus, a little of THE CELL thrown in there.<br /><br />Cary Elwes was his typical self, which unfortunately is not really suited for horror movies.  I found it hard to believe he was actually concerned with his situation.  Chained to a pipe in a bathroom with another guy chained to a pipe across the room, Leigh Whannell, who was more believable as a victim then Cary who seems just kind of ho-hum about it.  It seemed to me that he was just shooting the scenes to get his check, which is unfortunate because I like him as an actor.  When your star, Cary Elwes, is out done by a mechanical doll and a little girl, Cary's on-screen daughter, then you have a problem.  The loose thread that tied them and all the other characters together was ready to completely let go about half way through.<br /><br />Danny Glover, what happened to the Lethal Weapon star?  Starts as a cop who is searching for Jigsaw and just falls apart.  Your typical cop who is obsessed with catching the killer, who has a partner who isn't as obsessed, you can guess what happens to the partner, snaps, goes vigilante cop.  We see him investigate a couple of Jigsaw's murder victims, but it is more like who really cares?!  I saw, no pun intended, those murder types in SEVEN and done better I might add.<br /><br />The scene where the female victim who had escaped from Jigsaw was the best part of the movie. You actually cared at that point. She explains the contraption that was on her head and what she had to do to survive, see the movie if ya wanna know, I'm not gonna spoil it for ya.  The freaky little mechanical doll was also a nice touch. But once we go back to the two guys chained to pipes in a bathroom, you just don't care.  All the scenes when finally produced and put together seemed to be a patchwork of edited parts.  You put the dead guy scene here, the freaked out guy scene here, a screaming little girl scene, a weird mechanical doll scene here, and shake it all about, you do the movie making and you turn a profit now, that's what it's all about!! Sorry.<br /><br />And the ending, well, let's just say...So what!!  It felt to me like the script was written with a lot of holes in it and they filled those in is as they shot the movie and just said, "Well what do we do for an ending?"  When it ends, your just wondering "What the hell? Why is he so pissed at these people?"  These questions are answered, but it just felt like the killer's identity was decided on after they shot most of the movie. This movie could have been much much better, but it's attempt at a SEVEN type scare, just wasn't there.  Also, the director loves to use the fast motion effect, but it was way to abused.  I gave it 2 stars because of the dark settings, mood and the odd contraptions that Jigsaw used were innovative, but all the dark settings and weird contraptions can not make up for a weak story line.  I was more freaked out by the flying monkeys in WIZARD OF OZ.
i go to the movies a lot. I like horror, I like suspense. but i have been disappointed a lot because a lot of stuff that comes out is the same old type of story and very predictable. when i saw this film i couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. never has any kind of film done that to me. this is one of those films that you will either love it or hate it. if you hate it, that's fine just don't say that the people that love it are stupid. this is a good movie. the acting is good. it's not over the top, it's more real, like the way adam talks, he doesn't have all these cool one-liners, he talks like you and me and i appreciated that.
i just got back from my manager's house, and he already has this dvd. i'm not saying how he got it, but he has it already.  anyway, i watched this movie in the theater and left unhappy.  it has a decent flow, except for the parts where the camera gets hyperactive and crappy rock music blares for no real reason.  if it weren't for the stupid camera and crappy music, i would rate this movie higher.  don't believe me?  watch it, then you will see that i'm right.  the dvd is a pretty good deal.  possibly even worth buying for real slasher fans.  it comes in a cool case, but sadly the disc isn't really a saw...<br /><br />okay, if you haven't seen the damn movie, here's the plot...the whole thing:  two guys are trapped in a room and they are both chained to pipes, big ones.  there is a dead guy in the middle of the room, apparently he blew his brains out, and his gun is still laying by his hand.  a voice on an intercom system tells the men what to do...their goals while they are prisoners.  the doctor (Ewles) has to find a way to break free in an alotted amount ot time and shoot the other guy with the dead man's gun.  or they can both use the saws they find and cut through their ankles to get free, but probably bleed to death.  and then there is this whole flashback world with a serial...puzzler, that sets people up to try and get them to appreciate their lives...or they will die.  and there is this whole drama involving cops and the doctor's family that i'm not even going to get into...it's pretty typical, with a hint of originality every once in a while.  but there are some parts that you just can't help but chuckle, and not for good reasons...i think i only really jumped one time in this whole movie, and i knew it was coming, so that doesn't count.  but there are some pretty neat aspects of this movie, some good gritty scenes, but overall it feels like Seven/Se7en leftovers.<br /><br />anyway, there is a pretty funny commentary between the two guys that wrote the movie (i don't remember their names, James Wan and somebody Leigh or something). one of them was in the movie and the other directed it.  it helps me understand how some of the acting was just plain terrible when they talk about only having 18 days to shoot the movie, and having to use some of the rehearsal takes as actual footage for the movie.  there are a few parts in the movie, mainly Danny Glover's parts, that you just can't help but laugh at how bad his acting is.  Cary Ewles wasn't that great either...okay, the acting in this movie isn't the best, but that isn't going to stop it from becoming a cult hit.<br /><br />so, is this dvd worth buying?  yes and no.  if you're into slasher movies and don't really care about plot holes or acting, then you will enjoy this movie and the extra features on the disc, mainly the commentary, which is mainly funny 'cause the two guys behind the movie just poke fun at their own creation the whole time.  if you DON'T enjoy violence (there really isn't that much actually shown, blood and guts i mean), then you probably won't like this.  if you fall into the second category, just rent it first.<br /><br />Saw is a decent attempt at something new, and it succeeds for the most part.  i hear Saw 2 is coming out this October (2005), and i can only hope that they learn some good cinematography in the meantime, cause all that hard rock crap was really getting on my nerves, and it really destroys any possibility of true..."horror", if you will.  this dvd comes out tomorrow, and even if you've seen it in the theaters and liked it, rent it first, just to make sure it's worth owning and rewatching a million times before buying.  anyway, that's just my stupid advice.  i hope this helps at least one person.  sorry if not.
Lawrence (Elwes) and Adam (Whannell) wake up chained to pipes in the world's filthiest bathroom.  They have little freedom of movement and cannot even come close to reaching each other.  They do not remember how they got there or know each other.  Their captor (presumably) has left them two saws, an unloaded gun, a tape recorder,  two cigarettes, and a dead body in the middle of the room.  They are victims of the Jigsaw Killer, and that same killer is holding Lawrence's wife and daughter hostage.  At the same time, an ex-cop (Glover) is hunting down the killer, bent on revenge for the murder of his partner.<br /><br />"Saw" is an intense, twisted movie.  It is reminiscent of "Seven" in both mood and atmosphere, and leaves you with about the same feeling when it is all over.  For me, that is good, because I believe "Seven" to be an excellent movie.  "Saw", however, is not at that level...but it is close.  Director James Wan ratchets up the tension with each passing moment until the final scene.  And while the explanation might not hold up as well as the the viewer might like, it was still a hell of a ride.  Elwes especially does an excellent job as a man first confused by his situation, then terrified for his family, then resolute in what needs to be done.<br /><br />"Saw" is a great Halloween movie, and if you are looking for a good scary movie at this time of the year, "Saw" is your best bet.  Highly recommended for horror fans.
I saw this in distribution. I actually had to turn my head at certain points. This, along with Trent Reznor's soundtrack made for a great splatter flick. I thought the uncut version could only be better.....WRONG. It is not nearly as tense and nerve-racking as the theater version. Plus, they have replaced Reznor's soundtrack with something else. In this case, the orginal was much better. Be warned!
I LOVED this film! I have always been a fan of horror and thriller films, but lets face it, most of them are good only because of the bad guy! Hannibal Lecter is one of the best villians of all time, and while Jigsaw is good he still falls short of that title. But that aside, Saw is better than The Silence of the Lambs. The ending is jaw-dropping, and I'm sorry but the acting was NOT bad. Elwes has that certain charm that Keanu Reeves has. No he is not the best actor, but the director was going for realism and if you where in that same situation, guess what, you would be acting cinematically bad also. Saw is one of those movies that sucks you in, lets you get comfortable then smacks you right between the eyes. Lets face it, a good 3rd of it is a little slow, but then it picks up and doesn't stop to let you off, you just get pushed out at 100MPH. Go see this movie, don't look at it as if you are judging for the oscars, judge it as believable, after that I just hope you don't have any heart conditions.
1. Saw is one of the early blu-ray releases, so it's a single-layer (25GB) disc. It uses a high bit-rate MPEG2 encoding, which just can't keep up with some of the finer details and fast camera moves. As such, it looks a little better than what you would see on your HD satelite service.<br /><br />2. While the DTS-ES track is nice, it's still lossy audio. Given how dialogue driven this film is, this isn't too big of a deal.<br /><br />If this bluray is on super-sale (&lt;$8), and you LOVE the film, go for it. Otherwise, I would just record it on your DVR from whatever satelite/fiber HD service you have and watch that until a re-issued bluray with VC-1 and DTS-HD master audio comes out.
When `Saw' was first released it took the nation by storm.  It was the freshest thing to hit the world of horror and it still to this day has a large following.  With `Saw IV' set to hit theaters this weekend the anticipation is already thick for what new and disturbing things lay in store for the general public.  With the sequels though there has been an onslaught of critics for the original film as well calling it an overrated piece of trash.  I feel that this is an unfair assessment.  The original film was unique and thought provoking.  Finally we had a detour from the abundance of prefabricated copycats, horror films that relied heavily on severed limbs and large amounts of gore to establish a fan base.  This is not to say that `Saw' is lacking in the gore department, or even in the severed limbs area (just what do you think that `saw' is for) but it's smarter than that.  By the closing credits the audience has been forced to really open their minds, turn on their thinkers and delve into the material presented before them.  Saw is gritty, real, disturbing and most importantly stimulating.<br /><br />The film opens with two men waking up in a room alone with a corpse.  The two men are chained to opposite sides of the room, the corpse lying between them just out of reach.  The two men are Adam, a student, and Lawrence, a doctor.  Soon after awakening the two men are informed that they only have a short period of time before they are to be killed.  They have been left clues in order to lead them to survival but they must find and follow them.  Before long it becomes apparent that they are being toyed with by a mastermind bent on making them atone for past indiscretions.  As their sanity begins to fray they uncover that they are linked in more ways than their current situation.<br /><br />As far as acting is concerned, this is far from a showcase that's for sure.  Cary Elwes is somewhat all over the place here and Leigh Whannell (who co-wrote the film with director James Wan) is very amateur.  Danny Glover is decent as is Monica Porter but really the only effective actor is Tobin Bell and he's rarely seen, only heard.<br /><br />What `Saw' lacks in acting it makes up for in originality and sheer eeriness.  In fact this is one of the only films that have kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  It has been compared to `Se7en', which is a nice compliment (`Se7en' is the better film), but `Saw' really is a film all its own.  Aside from the scare tactics there really is no similarity between the two films.  The subsequent sequels have been less effective than this original and it's a shame that Hollywood rushes these things because of that `it' factor, embracing a hot commodity to the effect of tarnishing a good thing.  If only a little more time and effort had been placed into creating sequels with the same originality and gritty flare as this original film then maybe we would have a complete set of worthy horror films.  Sure `Saw' has its flaws (mostly found within the acting) but it works hard within the script and plot to make up for its flaws and deliver one disturbing, horrific and gruesome good time.
FINALLY,SOMEBODY CAME UP WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF HORROR MOVIE-AND IT'S EXCELLENT!FROM 2000-NOW,THIS IS THE BEST HORROR MOVIE!IT'S GORY,SUSPENSEFUL,SCARY,AND INTERESTING.IF YOU'RE INTO HORROR MOVIES-YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!THIS WHOLE HORROR MOVIE IS SOME KIND OF GAME.THIS IS A CLEVER MOVIE.I'LL DEFINITELY BUY MORE OF JAMES WAN MOVIES!
Jigsaw, what a crazy man, so he has an illness, okay so now everybody has to pay, espically the people who don't value thier lives or thier famliy, how messed up is that. Well it is twisted. this movie has an original story to it. its not like those other serial killer films. This movie rocks. and to top it all of it has the best and most suprising ending to it unlike most horror films. this movie is awesome.
The best psychological thriller I have seen, this movie will leave you in shock by the end. Smart and cleverly written by Aussie's Leigh Wannell and James Wan, and directed by the latter, this movie breaks down all the boundaries of on screen violence. Starring Wannell himself, his character Adam wakes in a bathtub in a room with no lights. He calls out for help and hears a strangers voice, the lights come on revealing the two chained and shackled in a grimy, abandoned, windowless industrial bathroom. And so the game begins... The two prisoners are victims of serial killer Jigsaw, well he really isn't a serial killer as we find out. He puts his victims through a dangerous game to test their will to live, and its up to the victim if they live of die.<br /><br />This movie is one hell of a rollercoaster ride which will appeal to fans of both horror and psychological thrillers. It was voted one of the most scary films of all time, and while I didn't find it too scary, its the reality that these crimes could happen to anyone that is most frightening.<br /><br />Filmed in only 18 days, most of it filmed in a warehouse, this is quality filmaking by a young up-and-comer. Many studios knocked this back which they surely must regret as it went on to gross over 55 million dollars.<br /><br />Buy it if you liked Seven, Kiss The Girls, The Bone Collector and Red Dragon.
Acting: forget it. Story: Ludacrous. However the production design (sets, the puppet, killer mechanisms) and the cinematography are worth mentioning - although I can tell you now that the stylish overall look of this film will seem awfully dated in a dozen of years.<br /><br />I'm giving this film 2 stars: one for the efforts of the production design team, the other one is to be shared by the marketing heads of the studio, the editor who cut one hell of a good trailer together and the graphic designer(s) who are responsible for the layouts of all promo material.
Jigsaw is a diabolical and ingenious menace.  He is not a serial killer per se, but someone who puts people in situations where they kill themselves and others.  Each victim finds themselves in tense situation where they have to make hard decisions regarding what they will do to go on living.  The main story concerns two individuals who awaken in an abandoned bathroom chained and confused.  In the middle of the room is a dead body in a spreading pool of blood.  There is a gun and a tape player, both out of reach.  But each of the two men have found a cassette with the words Play Me on them.<br /><br />The to men discover the game they are part of.  If successful, one of them will be dead.  If not, certain loved ones will die instead.  There are rules to be followed.  As the two become more and more desperate, we learn more about them and the evil mind that has put them in this situation.  Although the two are the center of the story, we also get tied up with several other victims and the police investigation.  The action get more and more tense as the time limit is almost reached.  In the end the story delivers with a series of twists at the end that just leave you stunned.  A very good film.<br /><br />This two-disk edition has some interesting features including the original short film that was expanded into the current film.  I have to say that it was a pleasure to see an intelligent horror film again (they are so rare).  I hope the sequel is just as intelligent.  The acting, action, and settings were top notch.  Several moments made me jump (also a rare thing).  As the credits began to roll and all of the twists sank in fully, all I could think was, "Neat!"  If you like your horror raw and intelligent then this is one for you.  If you just want a mindless killer like Jason, then this will not fit the bill.  Check it out.
well i am not much for words but i love hte uncut version of SAW better than the origianl cut of SAW you saw in the movie theaters.Plus it had more extra features to know what was what and its just plain good.Like i said i am not much for words but you should buy it if you love the SAW movies.
Solid film, very clever, I was pleasantly surprised.  But by know I'm guessing most everyone has at least heard of this film and its plaudits, so I'll skip to what I did come here to make everyone aware of.<br /><br />For this particular DVD, be careful with the special little liquid cover thing.  Mine ended up leaking somehow and ended up ruining both disks and covering the entire thing.  Hopefully this is not typical, because I do like the film very much and would like to still own it especially if it can be this version...but just in case everyone ought to be cautious with this particular copy just in case.
I avoided this film for so long until a friend loaned it to me. I watched it last nite and I was quite impressed. To compare this to "Se7en" is absurd; there's little or no comparison. Director James Wan's youthful zeal and excitement is beautifully executed, but nothing can compare to David Fincher's meticulous style.I was expecting another stupid slasher flick, and was pleasantly surprised to be presented with quite an original narrative that had me fascinated. I did NOT guess the ending, though I tried, because it was so well written and edited. The acting wasn't very good, though not totally unbelievable. After all, hysterical is an emotion that's hard to sustain for 98 minutes if you're an actor. James Wan's focus may not have been as precise as he'd wished, but I look forward to his next project. The extras on the DVD are minimal, but Mr. Wan's enthusiasm on a short extra impressed me. I enjoyed it and was entertained a lot.
I first saw this movie in the theaters and new then i was going to buy it. I bought this uncut version with special features and it does not dissapiont. It shows how saw came to be and how it was made and a look into the movie you wouldn't get with just watching it, it makes you appreciate the movie more. i recommend to all old enough to enjoy this!
This is by far the scarriest and most intense horror film that I've ever seen in my whole life. It's creepy and will have your skin crawling all over. It's also very gory and not for the faint of heart. It's also better than the second one, which although still good was a big let down. Watch this if you love horror films and have a tolerance for gore and violence.
I was impressed with the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in 2003...<br /><br />That's about it.  It just seems that no matter how hard they try, movie execs can't seem to release a decent horror film, something gritty and disturbing and downright horrifying.  They just can't do it.<br /><br />And then there was Saw.<br /><br />This movie is amazing in the fact that it breaks down to a simple formula of twists and thrills, bypasses the special effects and CGI crap that pollutes too many scary movies these days and focuses on something that could take place, something that could really happen versus the faux thrills expidited by cheap ghost storys and sci-fi.  This is the type of movie that will leave you disturbed long after you watch it.  You'll think about it a week, two weeks, a month later while you lay awake and wonder if there really is a man that sick and twisted...<br /><br />Yes...<br /><br />He is out there...<br /><br />So by now EVERYONE knows the premise.  Two men wake up in a nasty restroom chained to oposite ends and theres a dead man in the center of the room.  They both have choices to make, clues to unravel in order to make it out alive.<br /><br />That's all I'm going to tell you...<br /><br />Trust me, if you haven't seen Saw by now you need to watch this movie.  It is truly an origional film with genuine scares and real backbone.  Not for the faint of heart, but for the horror fan in us all, the fan whos getting increasingly preturbed with the lack of scares and the redundancy in recent horror instalments...this is for you my friends...<br /><br />Relish in it.<br /><br />It won't come again.<br /><br />Not for a long time...<br /><br />(Actually, Saw II is even better...but I didn't see that coming!)
SAW is one of those movies it will take you repeated viewings to dissect certain parts and understand the plot and the importance of the characters, and boy are you in for one hell of a surprise ending when you see it for the first time. This is one of the best suspense horror movies in recent years, and hopefully SAW II will be no different.<br /><br />SAW tells the tale of a serial murderer known as the "jigsaw killer" who decides to kidnap two men, one is a doctor who is married to a beautiful wife and has children with her, while the other man seems very insignificant to us, not bearing any importance or meaning to us in the movie, except that he committed some kind of heinous act according to the the killer. Both of these men are put in dank room with dirty white walls and a mysterious body lying in the middle of the room (and we're to believe that it's dead). The doctor (played by Cary Elwes) is handcuffed by the ankle to a fixture, and the other man is handcuffed by his wrist, and this ultimately becomes the precursor of an evergrowing race to break free and stop the killer himself. The jigsaw killer is committing a series of grisly killings, all the while tormenting the two men he has trapped. The movie's tension builds and paramounts into a shocking and grisly climax that ultimately descends into the movie's surprise ending...you will never see this coming, trust me. It worked quite well to jolt my chill factor. And this new UNCUT edition of the movie is even more grisly. You are going to be even more repulsed by this smart horror film.<br /><br />SAW spins a web of suspense, scares, and brains into a complex and jolting thriller that most certainly will prepare you for what's to come with it's follower, SAW II. Enjoy!
This is definately one of those movies you'll have to watch a few times to fully understand what exactly is going on.  This movie wastes no time as it opens with "Adam" and "Larry" chained to pipes in a long forgotten bathroom.  This movie will take you on a ride and leaves a great opening for a sequel I am very exciting about seeing.  If you are a fan or Horror movies, then this is for you.
Really great film all a round. Easily one of my favorites of last year. Totally original, totally creepy. Saw definitely delivers on all the horror/suspense levels... Maybe a few twists too many(?), but still easy to follow and still an excellent film.
THIS MOVIE IS VERY ENTERTAINING, FOR A RECENT TIME GE WE AREIN NOW, ANY MOVIE THAT MAKES U THINK, AND HAS THIS MUCH CREATIVITY IS A MUST SEE, U WILL APPRECIATE UR LIFE, RESPECT U LIFE,NOT WANT TO DO DRUGS OR ANYTHINGELSE THAT MAY SEEM WASTEFUL, I GOT IT TOTALLY!!

I'm not much of a movie buff, but I do like Mystery-Suspense-Thriller type movies.  "SAW" is one of the best movies of that genre that I've seen in a long time.  It starts off with a bang, and ends with a bigger bang!  It has lots of gore if you like that.  But most importantly, it makes you think and wonder about how things came about...all your questions might not be answered but hey, it's a highly entertaining movie, with a super cool ending, in my opinion!
Director:  James Wan<br /><br />Cast:  Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung,  Dina Meyer, Makenzie Vega, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson.<br /><br />Running Time:  100 minutes.<br /><br />Rated R for violence, lots of gore, and language.<br /><br />"Saw" is obviously a direct pseudo-"Seven", attempting to create a new kind of psychopathic serial killer and for the most part it succeeds-but eventually falls apart slightly at the seams.  The overall premise is very clever:  A young man (played by Whannell, who also wrote the film) and an established physician (a much heavier, less charismatic Cary Elwes than in previous works) wake up in a disgusting, polluted bathroom and have no recollection of how and why they wound up there.  They are chained to the walls and accompanied by only one guest-a dead man with his head blown off.  As the doctor and his youthful companion piece the puzzle together, they realize that they are being tormented by the infamous "Jigsaw" killer, a maniac who juxtaposes his victims within scenarios in which they have to choice between their own lives or the deaths of others.  The identity of the killer is unknown, but as the truth from both of the captured men seeps through, the film picks up momentum and unfolds to a rather incomplete, far-from-stanch climax.<br /><br />Danny Glover stars as the aging detective who was originally assigned to the "Jigsaw" case, but was unable to completely close the case.  Due to an increasingly devote fascination with the killer, the detective attempts to stop the evil murderer once and for all.  "Saw" does possess some pizzazz and intelligence, using Elwes and Co. as players in a strange and macabre game of chess; however, the film is too disjointed and acted with such mediocrity that it cannot be taken too seriously.  The novice director Wan uses some excellent, hip cinematography to liven up the film and create some tense atmosphere, but "Saw" is never incredibly scary, but does keep you guessing until the very last frame.  Disappointing performances from Elwes and Glover.  A nice attempt for modern horror film standards, but films such as "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs" did it much, much better.
I absolutely adore scary movies.  I had many people advising me that this movie was terrifying ... well, not really.  I did not find this movie that scary, but more of a definite mind game.  I enjoy the psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the absolute end.  Just when you think you have it all figured out ... you find you were completely wrong!!<br /><br />The plot revolves around two men who end up being trapped together by an unconventional serial killer.  Without giving too much away, he is unconventional in that he does not do the killing with his own hands.  To him, death is a choice his victims make on their own.  The puzzle slowly pieces itself together and all of a sudden, you know who is behind the killing ... well, you think you do.<br /><br />The ending is definitely not what you expect and it leaves you wanting more.  You will be kept guessing until the absolute very last moment.<br /><br />I have not come away so energized after a movie in such a long time as I did with this.  If you enjoy a psychological thrill ride, you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Just an aside ... I loved Cary Elwes in this movie.  A definite difference from Princess Bride!!
Audiences are jaded, especially horror fans, so it's extremely hard in this day and age to make a truly disturbing film on either the visual or plot levels without coming across as trying to hard. This film skates the edge of "trying to hard", and in my opinion falls on the side of genuine. What I like is that this film is stepping in the right direction, away from teen horror flicks and the "I'm a ghost and didn't know it" flicks that seem to dominate the genre. One of this films strengths is that most of it plays out in a minimal environment, much like Reservoir Dogs, which places the focus of the suspense and horror on the character's actions, and helps keep the jump scares to a minimum. Like in Se7en, what is disturbing in this film is the choices the characters make and why, not just the environment they are in like in the Dawn of the Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes. I also think that most of the devices and situations are believable if not original. What I don't like is the reliance on the "who dun it/surprise ending" which I feel is five years past overdone and boring. The film could have cut the last three minutes of revelation and been much stronger and might have earned the accolades it's been airing in it's TV and radio ads about the killer being placed next to many of the horror icons of the past thirty years. At the end of the day this film feels a lot like Se7en, but then that's not such a bad thing.
Great suspense and great plot= a great movie.  The only reason Im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the acting sucked.  Well everyone acted well in the movie except for Cary Elwes he was really bad in it.  But good movie nontheless. Dina Meyer, Shawnee Smith, Monica Potter, Alexandra Bokyun Chun are hot.  I never expected who the guy was I knew it was the orderly but I never thought of the ending.  Really good movie.
Sociopath movies usually aren't my bag but this film came recommended to me by a few unlikely sources so I checked it out.  When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to "Seven" started to float through my mind.  About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to "Seven".  Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan.  Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well.  About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed.  For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.
This unbelievable psychological thriller is one I won't soon forget. From the opening scene to the disturbing conclusion, I was completely engrossed. Beware though, if you have a weak stomach you may not want to watch this film. I personally have a love for movies of this sort and for me, the "gross" scenes are part of the ride! As I watched this movie my mind went in many directions trying to figure out who was responsible for the repulsive scenarios. But I was truly stunned when the villain was finally revealed. Utlimately, the thing I enjoyed most about SAW was the fact that the person responsible for the deaths was not even really a killer...he did'nt really kill anyone. He only set up scenarios where people would die trying to live! Disturbing, but D*mn good!!!
This is going to be quite a short review.  Why you may ask?  Well this film is based a lot on the mysteries surrounding it.  If i say too much, the mysteries are already solved.  So im going to attempt to say as little aobut this movie as possible.  Anything that i think might be damaging to your enjoyment of the movie is marked with the regular ###s<br /><br />This film messes with your mind.  A few times i had to think a bit "Okay is this in the present?  The past?"  It switches times and places on you without much warning.  However even with the sometimes rushed feeling of the film, it still wasnt quick enough.  The more you learn the more you want to learn.  There came a point when i was highly impatient and couldnt stand the thought that the movie had as much time left as it did.  Everything that went on was interesting to me and compeled me to continue watching just to see how things turned out.  Sometimes i have a tendency to pause the movie to get up and get something to eat or drink or whatever.  But that didnt happen once this movie started!  I HAD to know what was happening so there was no way i was pausing anything!  The last twenty minutes or so (possibly half an hour?) are VERY intense.  I found myself wringing my hands more than once.<br /><br />The gore factor is there, but not overstressed.  In fact reading the trivia on Internet Movie Database it says they took out some of the more gross scenes to get their rating down to an 'R' from a 'NC17'.  It also says that they used some of the reharsal takes for the movie.  Must be why Cary Elwes sometimes annoys me.<br /><br />###The mystery is actually quite simple.  But its SO simple that it ends up being quite complex.  You overthink yourself and what might be going on.  And ive probably already said more than i should.###<br /><br />Bottom line, DONT let anyone ruin this for you!  If you havent seen it, go out and get it NOW!
With a serial killer on the loose, two men awake to find themselves trapped within a decomposing bathroom, chained to the walls, together they are forced to find out who and why this is happening to them. This movie is disturbing, graphic, and mezmerizing and will have you sitting on the edge of your seats in disgust, horror, and pure enjoyment. This movie brings horror to a new level, and the thrills and chills are so constant you might have to pause the movie to let it all sink in.The gore in this movie is grisly and disturbing and sometimes extremely hard to watch - so watch at your own risk - but this movie will chill you to the bone, and will make you think twice about ever doing something that is considered "not acceptable" in today's society.
Over the last decade or so, little has excited the Hollywood establishment more than the 'Thriller', or 'Serial Killer Movie'. (Well not all thrillers involve serial killers, but virtually all the major recent ones do)  I generally don't watch these films.  Sure, 'Silence of the Lambs' was pretty good, and 'Seven' was good too, but most of these films just look tedious and formulaic, and what little I have seen has fulfilled these expectations. Now we have 'Saw', and I'm pleased to say that it isn't really a thriller, and leans more to the horror side of the spectrum.  Sure, there's a serial killer in the movie, and the visual style is massively indebted to Fincher, but at it's heart, 'Saw' is really just a low-budget horror film.(Only about a million dollar budget, shot in 2 1/2 weeks)  These sorts of films can't complete with major productions in terms of acting and production values, so they put all the emphasis on ideas and scenes.(Well, the good ones do, anyway)  So understand this all coming in- the acting isn't going to be up to major production standards, and the plot isn't going to be as developed or plausible.  If you can't get over those two things, you aren't going to enjoy this.  'Saw', however, makes up for it in other ways.  It's got frightful, intriguing ideas and interesting scenes and a strong, expressionistic (if derivative) visual style.  It may not all add up cleanly at the end, but the scenes are good enough that that doesn't really matter.<br /><br />Though I'm sure everyone already knows, the basic setup is this: Adam and Lawrence wake up in an old, abandoned bathroom.  They are each chained to pipes on the opposite sides of the room.  There is a corpse in between them, an apparent suicide victim, who is holding a tape player and a gun.  They soon learn that they are the victims of the Jigsaw killer, who places people in a elaborate games of death, from which they may be able to escape alive.  They will have to suffer, however.  In this case, Jigsaw requires that Lawrence kill Adam by 6:00, or else Jigsaw will kill Lawrence's family.  The rest of the movie is just their attempts to deal with this situation, and some flashbacks to help them figure out just what is going on.(They're more than a little disoriented, initially) This basic setup is more horror than thriller, as the police only play a very minor role, and there is very little investigation into the killer's life or identity.  They are simply common people in a life or death situation, who must escape.  In lots of ways, the basic plot is pretty Giallo-esque.(Italian thriller precursors which involved a crime investigation,but almost invariably placed style, atmosphere and set-pieces ahead of plot or plausibility)  It uses numerous giallo conventions: the protagonists are regular people, every character matters, the killer's motivation is very giallo-esque (can't be completely specific w/o giving too much away) most everything proves to be connected, and the mandatory twist ending is more of a ludicrous sick joke than a grand revelation. (Not to say that I don't like the ending. I like it a lot)  Naturally, this sort of film is even more convoluted and unlikely that you typical thriller, and I suspect it's just a reflection of sloppy writing rather than same grand scheme, but it reveals the general aesthetic of both these types of films: scenes and ideas first, plot second.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a combination of ultra grimy, sleazy settings with a few high-class but cold and dark places as well.  As I said before, it is massively indebted to David Fincher's work, but that's a very good style.  Well worth ripping off.  The intense griminess and stylization of visuals also sets it apart from most thrillers, as it is taken to such a point that the world no longer seems even remotely real. (Though some thrillers are like this. i.e. `Seven',) Sometimes Wan over does it a little, with some fast-motion-spinny-camera stuff that's just sorta silly, but most of the time it works.  There are some very weird visuals that are, once again, quite typical of independent horror and giallos while being foreign to mainstream thrillers.  For example, `Jigsaw' likes to use a disturbing little ventriloquist dummy as his avatar while communicating with his victims.  He can also be quite flamboyantly dressed, with a huge, shimmery red or black cloak and a bizarre mask.  There's really no explanation why he would choose to be like that, he just does, because the filmmakers thought it would be cool or scary.  Though the film is very dark and grisly it isn't extremely gory.  Much of the violence is shown fairly obscurely or not at all, but what happens is conceptually nasty enough that it is plenty effective even without being given a close, detailed view.  What gore there is is generally fairly well done, particularly considering the budget they had.<br /><br />As I keep saying, this film has great scenes, even if they doesn't always make all that much sense.  Most notably, the whole setup is just great, I think.  Convoluted and highly, highly unlikely, but great.  Some specifics:  A particularly effective scene is when we see the ordeal of Jigsaw's one surviving victim, who had to dig a key out a man intestinal track in order to remove a giant metal device from her heard, which is set to rip her jaws apart if she takes too long.  Similarly excellent is the scene where Adam is abducted, as he wanders about his powerless apart, randomly taking pictures to provide a small, brief bit of illumination.  And, the climax, while I cant go into specifics, is really very intense and grisly.  A very effective closing the the film.<br /><br />Despite what anyway may tell you, the acting in this film is perfectly serviceable.  No, it isn't first-rate, and they occasionally blow some lines, but most of the time it's at least passable.  And anyone who really has that big of a problem with the acting doubtless isn't much of a horror fan, so who cares what they think.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Not terribly plausible, but I've never cared about that much anyway.  Virtually everything else works quite well.  Check it out.
This is one of the most original movies I've ever seen and since it ranks as one of my favorite movies, I decided to let others know.  I'm a big fan of horror/thrillers and I really enjoyed this movie.  I won't tell you any details because I think it's better to not know almost everything that happens, like some reviewers write.  I'm not saying there's something wrong with people doing that, but I'd rather just give my opinion and of course not everyone will agree with it.  I would recommend watching this if you're into suspense thrillers.  There's alot of gore in it, so if you're not into that, I'd stay away from it.  lol  I hope you like it as much as I did and let me know if this was helpful!
I must say this movie totally caught me by surprise. I almost refused to watch it thinking it was just another gorey, plotless, no-story, let's try to scare some people, worthless movie. But then I watched it. I was shocked. I will say that this movie was brilliant. Aside from subpar acting performances, this movie was excellent.<br /><br />Now, this and SE7EN are very different movies but I will say that Saw was very comparible to that film. It's a look inside the mind of a psychopathic killer who believes they've got it all figured out and is trying to prove a point through these "situations" he is putting people in, who, in turn are to attempt the save their own lives by doing something quite desperate and abnormal. I grow tired of movies that serve no purpose but to try to scare, ex. The Ring, The Grudge, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. They make little sense, loose ends are rarely tied together, the plot is generally insignificant. But this was different. The story really keeps you thinking, and you stay on the edge throughout the movie.<br /><br />What I really liked about this movie was something the director accomplished that most try to do but few can succeed. He makes you believe that you've got it all figured out (on a few occasions), and everything is coming together just like you predicted, and BAM, the ending throws it all right back in your face. All I could do at the end of this movie was smile and say "Bravo" and give it a good clap. It was brilliant.<br /><br />I do have a few qualms though bringing it down to a 4 star. They are: acting...questionable. I guess that is because I'm not sure I've seen Kary Elwes in a serious role like this one, I mean, look at his resume: Robin Hood Men in Tights, Hot Shots, The Princess Bride (excellent movie), etc. It was kind of like placing Leslie Nielson in...I don't know...The Patriot as General Cornwallace? You get the picture. There was something else I thought was strange but effective. There is a car chase scene where the camera jumps around and is sped up and the drivers are both kinda crazy...it all came off kinda goofy to me, not too big a deal though.<br /><br />In all, if you think this is another "scare" movie, it's not. The previews did a poor job I must say. Give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Very well done, minus the casting.
Saw was interesting.  I think I was expecting a more senseless out-and-out gore fest and while it is gorey, it pretends to have higher aspirations.  That is actually what kind of diminsihed the film's fun factor for me.  The whole theme about appreciating life, the cat and mouse intrigue were fine - actually it then raised my expectations for the film.  The problem is that after that, the script gets a little sloppy.  The ending is quite frustrating and just a little too silly given the greater depth they had hinted at earlier.  Some fine scary moments and supsense are guaranteed however.<br /><br />Elwes' real accent keeps slipping out toward the end as his anger and fustration mount and numerous folks have pointed out the kill-him-while-you-have-him gaffe that occurs multiple times.  Both annoying factors as the film moves along.  Still, it can be a fun ride for thriller people.
I really didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie.  People tried to explain it to me, but they couldn't really convey in normal conversation the true twisted plot of this movie.<br /><br />Two guys are chained in a disgusting bathroom together, and they have to crack clues and solve some pretty twisted puzzles to prove that they want to stay alive.  Supposedly these guys don't know each other...or do they?<br /><br />During the movie, you may THINK you have it figured out.  I don't know if the writers make it seem incredibly predictable on purpose...or if it kind of just happened.  It's hard to tell.  Once I DID think that I had it figured out...I thought that would either be a really incredible plot twist or a SMASHING surprise ending.<br /><br />The movie doesn't really satisfy in that way.  There is a plot twist and a surprise ending, but it's only mildy entertaining. What I did like about this movie was the incredibly twisted and wierd mind of this serial killer...and the stomach churning gory scenes.  It truly entertains for the "Seven" lovers in us.<br /><br />For a low-budge movie, Saw isn't half bad.  There ARE better movies for those of us that enjoy this kind of thing, but it's worth giving Saw a watch if even for the sh-t's and giggles.
It was a decent horror movie. I psyched myself out for this disgusting amazingly scary film, but i completely over-psyched myself. This is a grade C mystery, not a gory horror movie. The acting was incredibly cheezy, and there was nowhere near the amount of terror i expected. There were no parts in which i jumped, no parts where i grabbed my stomach in disgust. HOWEVER:This movie is worth seeing once, because the ending is AMAZING. But to all my fellow horror fans, see it once, but dont get your expectations too high. If you want real gory horror, check out the 1974 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's a classic.
There were some things that didn't make sense in this movie. For starters, the Asian cop who was killed in that house of horrors. You would think there would be a major criminal investigation in that place. But no. Nothing. And why did they go alone instead of calling for backup? That didn't make sense. Another thing, we're to believe these people are being put through all this because of something bad they've done in their lives but the two main characters in the film who are chained up have done nothing wrong. The doctor was going to have an affair but he didn't. The other guy who works at the hospital...well there weren't any questions answered about him. I can't bring up the biggest problem in the movie without giving the ending away. All in all, the movie was all right. I liked the set up but it lacked suspense and the plot just didn't make sense.
Saw is a movie that starts out stylish and smart and gets silly and dumb before it ends. When watching the beginning and middle I thought "how could Richard Roeper call this one of the worse movies of 2004". Then as it gets closer to the end I thought "ok I get it now, that's why". Carey Elwes (Kiss the Girls) gives about the same bad performance that Kim Basinger did on Cellular. It's overly dramatic and just laughable. Still entertainly laughable at least.<br /><br />  Anyway the movie is about a killer who gets people to kill themselves trying to escape. They are people who have wanted to kill themselves and he gets them to fight to try to live. The movie is entertaining through-out even if it does lose it's touch a little at the end. It starts out as a good mystery/horror film and becomes just  laughably bad entertaining at the end.  Still it is a lot better than most recent horror films that came out recently.
Saw will never become a genre classic like Seven or The Silence of The Lambs. Although it shares many similarities with these movies, it still has too many plot holes and quite a few thing going against it to stand proud with those films. So why am I giving the film 4 stars? Because Saw offers one heck of a great time, that's why.<br /><br />The Jigsaw Man abducts his victims and gives them a challenge they need to meet in order to survive. When a doctor and a young photographer wake up chained in an old decrepit building, the only thing standing between them is cassette player and a saw. They find tapes in their pockets that they will need to play in order to understand the rules of the game; if the doctor isn't able to free himself and kill his partner in less than twenty-four hours, then his family will also be murdered (since they're handcuffed, there's only one real mean of escape... I'll let you figure it out for yourself).<br /><br />The film is shlocky and the performances (especially Elwes) are often laughable. But what the film delivers, it delivers it great. There are many very intense moments in this one, so many scenes that make you jump out of your seet of make you cringe that it's more than worth the price of the DVD. One flashback sequence in particular is incredibly disturbing and so horrifying you'll be holding your breath until it's over.  Forget about major plot holes (the surprise ending makes no sense at all). In fact, stop thinking and just enjoy the ride for what it is.<br /><br />Grimmy, atmospheric, dark and disturbing, Saw is a horror movie you'll want to watch with your hands covering your eyes. A great source of entertainment, if nothing more.
It's a shame that every single producer passed on this film in Austalia. The Australian film industry is primarily concerned with cultural identity, therefore it tends to overlook minor details such as profitability. This is not a brilliant film, but it is good and it has made a ton of money. All of Whannell's influences are transparent, which is not necessarily a bad or good thing.<br /><br />I have a  sneaking suspicion that the idea for the film could have been inspired by the final scene of Mad Max where Johnny has the option of sawing his leg off or dying, because I know Whennell a big fan of The Road Warrior.
i saw (no pun intended...lol) i was this at the movies and thought it was a great suspense thriller... it will keep you captivated and on the edge of your seat till the end. i have it a 4 star rating cause i felt the movie could have been alot better and more in depth about each character, puzzles, and actors.... overall great movie and i will buy it when it comes out....
I SAW THIS MOVIE WHILE OVERSEAS(DIRECTORS CUT) ITWAS SO GOOD TO FINALLY SEE A HORROR MOVIE THAT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION AND MAKES YOU FEEL THE FRUSTRATION OF ALL THE CHARACTERS INVOLVED. BRAVO TO THE WRITERS FOR THERE EXPERT WRITING AND DIRECTION OF THIS MOVIE. YOU ARE WONDERING ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
i saw this movie as soon as it came out and it was worth every penny i paid to see it. this is definitly one of the best suspense/horror films i have seen in a long time. i have not felt fear like this since watching horror flicks as a child. this is a great movie and i recommend for everyone to watch it, put it on for your friends,invite your family.this movie is definitly going down in history as one of the best thought out films ever. the gore is beautifully done. horror and gore fans this is really THE ONE to see!!!!!!!!!!!!a must have for any horror fans dvd collection.
I am a absolute hardcore fan of horror movies, and I have seen most of them, from 28 days later to The Ring to House of 1000 Corpses to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But, of all of the horror movies I have ever seen, Saw has to be the best piece of work ever created. Lions Gate Films has a knack for horror movie (as they have produce many, like House of 1000 corpses), and they have landed another great one with Saw. I would strongly reccomend to any fan of horror movies to see and buy this. It is extremely well made and everything about it is flawless.<br /><br />To start off, Saw has to be the most intriguing story of any movie ever made. It is about two guys, who wake up in a gritty kind of bathroom, eack chained to a thick pipe. In the middle of the room is a dead man, with a revolver and tape recorder in his hands. The story unfolds to be one about a psychotic killer called the Jigsaw killer, who stalks people and puts them in bizzare situations, and they must do something gruesome to remain alive. An Example is a man who wakes up in a small room, covered in a gel, with only a candle, safe, and tape recorder in the room with him. On the tape is the Killer saying how he injected a slow acting poison in his system, and the antidote is in the locked safe. The combination is written on the wall, but there are literally thousands of numbers on the wall. There is a candle in the dark room, but he learns that the gel on his body is highly flamable, so he must be careful. I will not give away if he makes it out because it would spoil part of the movie. Also, at the end, there is what has to be the most shocking twist EVER MADE in a movie. It left my jaw dropped for about 20 minutes after the movie ended. The story is simply a work of pure genius.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is so-so, but it is acceptable. What is kind of cool is that the co-producer actually aacted in the movie. He plays Adam, one of the guys loked in the room. one of the only well known actors in this movie is Danny Glover.<br /><br />This movie is definetly one for the older crowd, because of extremely graphic violence and torture situations. The language is not very bad, with only a few F-words thrown in to make it sound a bit more jazzed up. The scare factor is also high, especially for younger viewers, because the stuff in this movie is the stuff nightmares are made out of. I even jumped, even after seeing a lot of other horror movies (i never was scared before), and this movie left me walking out of the theatre extremely disturbed, yet very satisfied about witnessing pure genius at work.<br /><br />Overall, Saw is definetly the best movie I have ever seen, and I will buy it the day it comes out. I hope Febuary 15 will come sooner. Definetly a must see, must buy, and overall just a movie you cannot miss.
I thought the story itself was really good and really interesting, however, I thought the acting was lacking. It did have some intense and suspenseful moments, but not as many as I was hopping for. I also wasn't scared at all, which really suprised me seeing as how the commercials looked really spooky. All in all I was very disappointed!<br /><br />I did like how the movie ended, though.
Pardon my theft from a classic Easy Money line, but this movie just plain stunk. Saw is a Seven clone but without the heart, soul or intensity of the original psychological thriller. Saw tries in every way to mimic the better aspects of Fincher's masterpiece, the ultra-quick cuts, the psycho who's fed up with the wrongs of society and the no win choice that the main character of this film is left with. Cary Elwes plays Lawrence, a middle aged surgeon who is married with a small daughter. Elwes just doesn't have the grit needed to pull off this grimy, dirty, angry role. He's too much of a pretty boy and you can see right through his rantings and ravings as ultra-scripted. The plot twists a number of times but the ending has to rank among the worst I've ever seen. It leaves the viewer angry and feeling hollow, besides this, lots of loose ends are never tied up. The premise is what drew me to the film certainly not the star power (or lack of star power for that matter) eventhough Danny Glover does play a cop in search of the killer. Saw is late night cable fare at best and a poor imitation of an original idea (Seven). Not Recommended.
My husband convinced me to join him at a "sneak" preview of Saw this evening. Well I saw it and all I can say is I haven't laughed that hard since I saw Scary Movie. The only problem is I don't think this was supposed to be a comedy! Was it bad? Oh yeah! Is it worth renting? Oh no!
Here's the gist...<br /><br />The creators of this film obviously saw such films as the Usual Suspects and Seven and said "Hey I want to make a movie like that, except not particularly intelligent or inspired in any way."<br /><br />The vaunted villain is the worst sort in movies like these. They want him to be a genius, but instead of being particularly cunning or intelligent they instead just make everyone else him the movie such an idiot that he's basically allowed to get away with anything. minor spoiler: Why risk a two year murder investigation by rushing off to a serial killer's home alone when the evidence you've turned up could easily supply a warrant in a couple of hours? Well, so that you can go out without backup and give the killer a chance to slaughter your partner and escape, of course. This is just an example of the unprovoked idiocy in this movie.<br /><br />The movie's pretty predictable, always goes for the cheapest gore flash rather than trying to actually be frightening, and doesn't make a great deal of sense if you pay attention. Shift yourself into the mode of "What would happen next if they just wanted the least likely thing to happen without worrying about if it makes sense" and the entire movie, even the end, is entirely predictable.<br /><br />Save your time. Just watch one of the many, better, movies that inspired this one instead.
This movie has a great plot but as it was one of the first released titles on Blu-Ray it has poor picture quality.  If you want to show off your new blu-ray player try to get some of the more recently released titles as they have much better picture quality.
This film could have been so much better. As a die hard horror fan I thought this movie had a lot to offer. The story although it borrowed from Seven was still fairly interesting, and the mood was very creepy. The acting however, particulary in the last act falls completely apart. In the theater everyone started laughing that's how bad it got. It's really a shame though, this one had potential. A true blue horror film with an R rating and no cutesy teens. I've heard that much of the acting sucked because the budget didn't allow for any second takes and most of what made it into the film were more like practice takes than real takes. It's really a shame that a jackass like Michael Bay can secure millions for junk like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon, and the creators of Saw couldn't even finish their movie the right way.
OK, other reviewers have eruditely dissected the basic contrivances and joys or dissapointments found within, so I'll cut to the chase as this seems like a film you'll either find clever or absolutely loathe. Give yourself 1 point for every statement you agree with in the quiz below:<br /><br />*I am often despondent over the happiness usually found in what  I consider contrived Hollywood endings. This is not because I'm dark or cynical, it's because I'm realistic.<br /><br />*I like to be suprised, so much so that I'm willing to suspend all reason and logic as long as I'm caught off guard.<br /><br />*House of 1,000 Corpses is an underrated and missunderstood film, I just wish it wasn't so mentally taxing.<br /><br />*The Brad Pitt movie Se7en is desperately in need of an inferior gimmick ridden sequel and/or knockoff featuring poor acting and laughable dialogue. I hope somebody fills that void.<br /><br />*I like to sit alone in my room and angrily stew about the possibility that people I don't know may or may not be be wasting their lives. I know being judgemental is wrong, but trust me, I have worse habits. The only thing that bothers me is that no one else seems to be able to relate to this strange obsession.<br /><br />*My guilty pleasures are mens bathrooms, strange masks, looking at people who are chained up and ogling Danny Glover as he mails in his performance in yet another cop role. If only someone could combine all those themes. That would take a genius though...<br /><br />If you agreed with all six of these statements, then congratulations, you're most likely insane. Purchase this movie immediately. Watch it daily and your life will suddenly take on previously unseen meaning. If you agreed with five or less of these statements, you will most likely find this movie either repulsive, boring, comical, or just plain idiotic. The fact that you actually worked hard and traded your money for the ability to view this will slowly gnaw away at any kind of happiness you may have felt earlier in the day. You may feel as if you were flim-flammed and duped. Choose wisely.
OK, so when I went to the theater to see this one I was thinking "another lame 'Ring' or 'THe Others" I was very,very wrong.<br /><br />  This movie is one of the creepiest and screwed up movies I have seen in a long time. A long time being since I've seen House of 1000 Corspes (a classic). Anyways, I must say that if you missed it in theaters, don't smack yourself in the face too much- watch the DVD. Why? Have you ever wanted to see some fat guy tunnel his way through a tangle of razor wire? You'll see it here. There's also many other crazy ways that people get killed-and there's a toy clown that actually MAKES the movie. Watch this, you'll love it!!
When I "SAW" this movie I knew there would be an sequel. If they can top this, the "SAW will go down in history has the thinking man's movie.
I am a huge fan of the horror genre, as long as it isn't a monster movie (e.g. A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc.) and the T.V. spots that were in my market made this film out as a monster movie, so I over looked it when Saw hit theatres fall of 2004. I now regret coming into the Saw fan club late. Thanks to Scary Movie IV, I decided to go ahead and check it out and I absolutely love this film.<br /><br />It progresses a little slow and the acting isn't the best, but what can you expect on a low budget film? Nevertheless it is a very intelligent film and the ending will honestly make you say "WOW". No one I've ever talked to that has watched this film has been disappointed, and no one has seen the ending coming.<br /><br />This is a first rate horror film that every horror fan, or any fan of a film that has logic and brains, should see.
Every now and then a horror movie emerges from the underground, made by a fine bunch of young people, who all share a genuin enthusiasm for the genre in general and for some new hot ideas in particular.<br /><br />In the early eighties a young Sam Raimi messed around in the woods with some friends, a camera and a handful of nasty demons. The result: "The evil dead", a funny, sparkling and nasty little horrorflick with some powerhouse inventive camerawork, created mainly out of budget limitations.<br />Just a few years back, young maverick director John Carpenter set new standards in the slasher genre with "Halloween", again a low budget film, with some intruiging cinematic techniques to go along. Go back again a few years and you stumble upon "The Texas Chainsaw massacre", again made by a young, inexperienced but extremely motivated crew on a shoestring budget, forcing all involved with the filmmaking into a creative kind of minimalism.<br /><br />Now, in the beginning of the new milennium there is again a small little horrorfilm, that oozes as much childlike, playful enthusiasm as it does gallons of blood. I admit, there is more special effects and blood splashes then in its predecessors and a more physical approach to the pain and suffering, but it's done with so much tongue-in-cheeck, that you are more than happy to go along with.<br /><br />The setting in "Saw" is in a quircky sort of way not much different then the classics I mentioned above: In "Halloween", "The evil dead" and "The Texas Chainsaw massacre" the protagonists are inside a house and the evil is out there and it is coming to get them. Going back to Roman Polanski's best work: you'll see the same: The frigide girl in "Repulsion" fights to keep intruders out of her house, as does the pregnant woman in "Rosemary's baby" when she slowly starts to realize that all other appartment inhabitants might not be as innocent as they seem.<br /><br />In "Saw" the two main characters find themselves in a filthy, abandonend bathroom like cellar. They are not, however, because they choose so, and this is immediately a different kind of approach. The young men are bound by physical chains and by a whole bunch of mental ones.<br />Cryptic talk by a menacing, unseen maniac force them time and time again to reconcider the whole situation and slowly accept the fact that there is a hidden, underlying connection between the both of them, although from the start it is suggested that the two never met before.<br />To put things even worse, only together they have a chance of getting out of this mess, but their stalker makes it very clear to them early on, that one of them has to die.<br />And from there on, it only gets worse.<br /><br />Paranoia, blood, gutted humor, plot twists, sawed of limbs, buddy-movie-things, and mind bending puzzeling to go along, and all slick but juicyful put together with dazzeling camerawork, fast paced editing and chilly atmosphere, giving us the same feeling as the audience got when they saw the above mentionend grand daddy's in this genre.<br /><br />And, yes, "Saw", as fresh and young as it is, may still be a baby now, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if in ten years time, another new scary movie would come along, hinting with much delight at this one, making it an instand "Another Great Granddaddy Of The Genre"
Two men, Leigh Whannell and James Wan, obviously had a lot of time on their hands when creating the now breakthrough film that redefined what Horror really is; "Saw".<br /><br />The story goes about when two strangers find themselves trapped in a mysterious room chained from the leg to the wall.<br /><br />Now, for a plot as simple as that, the creativity has room to grow and even to pulsate with ingenious gimmicks and clever plot twists.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about this movie is the fact that it started out dark and began to open up more, almost like it was giving birth to the new creative side of franchise horror, introducing you to the new baddie that will take the place of Freddie Kruger, Jason Vorhees, and the Seven Killer. In fact, one would say that the tone of the movie has a slighly "Se7enish feel."<br /><br />The good part is that that doesn't take away from the excitement or the suspense. Along the way, the film educates you on the one holding them hostage and his method of killing. The Killer, apparently called Jigsaw, wants the victim's to figure out the puzzles of the death game that he has created. There are several ways to escape but all of them are either preconceived or pre-thout out ahead of time in where the chances of survival and escaping are both on a very jagged plane.<br /><br />I'd say that this movie finally captures what every other director was trying to do with modern day Horror. I'll go one step further and say that this movie Re-invented the Horror franchise. And, for a first try, debut film, these two filmakers really raise the bar higher than ever anticipated.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this film if you are a hardcore horror/thriller fan but also want the thinking that goes along with it, as with the Movie Seven.<br /><br />I saw this movie when it first came out around Halloween and let me tell you that this Franchise did something Newer, Bolder, and that they have invented a new Franchise for the Horror fans in need. You ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM!!!<br /><br />IT'S GREAT!!!!<br /><br />I GIVE IT TEN STARS!!!!!!
I really liked the premise of this movie and understand why it spawned a sequel, but what about that terrible acting!?!  Everyone in the movie seemed to be 'phoning in' their performance.  This movie was fairly original and disturbing, but just think how good it could have been.
Very enjoyable, and I did not find it mean spirited.  Imaginative, unpredictable, and I DID NOT figure it out or see the end coming.
Finally got to see this movie and this is a very good DVD.<br /><br />Saw has a great premise and spooky villian, that kept me watching all the way.<br /><br />It has flaws for sure, the acting is strained but its backed up by a few bigger actors on board.<br /><br />Where it delivers is in the spooky atmosphere and shocks and the ending which I thought was really interesting but<br /><br />I'm not too sure I understand it - ah well it was different and thats all you can ask for a movie.<br /><br />Now must go see saw 2!<br /><br />check it out.
for the people who gave one star for this movie:<br /><br />stop wining like a dog, what is wrong with u people?<br /><br />this was a great movie and deserves every star.so if u like pshycologic horror movies ,defenetly buy it!
It was a geneously nerve pinching movie, acting was tiring at times but Leigh Whannell's performance in the last two minutes of the film was orgasmic, you can't beat seeing that kind of true-intense fear on a cute guys face. I would recommend it to a select audience but enforce the fact that it's a good nighttime movie. You aren't afraid of the dark are you?
This was a fun movie to watch, except maybe for the scenes with the annoying split second MTV editing.  The suspense builds throughout the movie and the death scenes are fairly chilling.  The ending is somewhat disappointing... It was the old "last minute surprise twist" ending that has been overused since season 2 of Scooby Doo.  I also felt it owed a bit too much to Seven, which is a superior film.  I noticed some reviewers complained about Cary Elwes' over the top performance... While I agree that it was over the top, I don't think it took anything away from the movie.  I felt that it even provided a little bizarre comic relief (especially towards the end).  I'm glad I saw it.  It was a nasty little serial killer movie with an above average plot and execution.  I don't think it's fair to say it's on the same level as "Silence of the Lambs" or "Seven".  However, it is in the same genre as those films.  It has more of a raw, dark psychological thiriller feel, as opposed to straight horror (like "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" - which is the best serial killer horror movie of all time, in my opinion).  Anyway... I recommend it, but not that highly.
this was  a very original film. it has clever traps, good acting, and a genius plot twist. watch it, savor it, cause this is original as they get. not to say that i don't like the sequels though, i like them all, save the fourth one. but this one is ORIGINAL.
Actor-writer Leigh Whannel stars with Cary Elwes and Danny Glover in this horror-thriller in the vein of Seven. Newcomer James Wan takes on the directing duties for this ambitious, but flawed film called Saw. Financed by Lions Gate Films which is quickly earning the reputation for taking chances on small, low-budget horror films that other major studios and their independent house won't touch.<br /><br />Saw succeeds in creating a palpable dread and tension as the character of Adam (Whannel) and Lawrence (Elwes in scenery-chewing mode) wake up with no memory of how they got into chained-up in adingy and dimly lit shower room. Slowly the two characters try to figure out why they've been chained into pipings in the room. Soon ehough a tape recorded message informs them of the situation they're in and all of it due to demented criminal who the press and the police have dubbed Jigsaw. The premise of their incarceration is simple. Jigsaw wants them to play a game where they must find clues and tools hidden around the room and escape from just in time to save Lawrence's wife and daughter. This premise and the reasoning as to why they must play this game is one of this film's strong points, but it also becomes one of its flaws as the Whannel overwrites the dialogue into trying to explain everything through the Elwes character. Whannel as a writer doesn't seem to trust his audience to solve or even understand the premise and Jigsaw. Unlike Seven which gives just enough hints and clues for people to try and solve the problem, Saw pretty much tries to give everything away. Fortunately, the story in convoluted and twisty enough that the audience might be confused by the time Elwes character over-explains everything. Saw is the kind of film that surely would've benefitted from the concept of less is more.<br /><br />The acting is average to say the least with Elwes chewing up every scene he's in. It's hard to gauge whether Elwes' performance was due to the pedestrian script he had to read from or if he thought that was what the character needed. Either way his character dominated the film even in scenes when he should've stayed in the background. Whannel as an actor is believable enough and probably a level better than as a writer. Though he was abit too subdued, but then that might've been due to the fact he had to act opposite of the over-the-top Elwes. Danny Glover makes an appearance as a burned-out cop whose earlier run-in with Jigsaw led to his partner's death and him scarred for life. Glover's seems to barely register in the film and his character seems abit tacked on to give the story an added dimension to make it complex. Horror films should really try to stay simple.<br /><br />Saw does deliver in the gore department, but not overly much. It just had enough squirm-inducing scenes in the beginning, middle and end chapters to make the film worthwhile to fans of R-rated horror. This film will not be mistaken for one of the PG-13 Japanese ghost remakes of the last five years. As stated earlier this film owes alot more to Fincher's Seven than to Nakata's Ringu series. The quick frantic beginning makes way for a middle part where too much talking and not enough horror sequences. Fortunately, the pacing speeds up once more in the last 10-15 minutes as Jigsaw's game and manipulations come to a bloody and twisted end.<br /><br />One thing to mention as a stand-out character even though he's only on the screen a limited time is the genre actor Tobin Bell who plays Jigsaw with a twisted sense of tragic nobility. As much as Jigsaw may be the demented creator of the game and trap Adam and Lawrence have been put in, it was very difficult not to admire Bell's character. He's not on par with Hannibal Lector, but he has that potential to be one of the classic cinematic villains.<br /><br />In the end, Saw was a good enough horror movie for fans of the genre. Though casual horror fans may be more shocked with the film's scenes and premise than hardened horror-aficionados. Saw could've been very good or great if not for its overexplanation of everything going on in the scene and the average acting performance of most of the cast. Tobin Bell's performance being the only real highlight of the entire group. The ending of Saw seems well-suited for sequels. I wouldn't mind seeing what new complex game Jigsaw has in mind for a new set of unworthies.
WOW! If you think the trailers were good, this film is fantastic. There were several times I jumped during the movie. This is a true modern day thrill ride, and edge of your seat experience that will leave you watching you back for weeks to come!
2004's SAW was and still is one of the best thrillers I've seen in quite a while.  First-time director, James Wan, along with first-time writer, Leigh Whannel, have concocted a smart, stylish, edgy, and boldly twisted movie about a serial killer whose goal is to place people in life or death situations in order to gain an appreciation for life.  This interesting concept focuses on Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and his cellmate (Whannel).  They awake to find themselves chained to pipes in a "subterrainian bathroom" with a body laying in between them laying in a pool of blood holding a tape player and a gun.  Once the men find the tapes in their pockets they listen to their instructions: Lawrence must kill Adam by 6 pm or else Lawrence's wife (Monica Potter) and daugher (Mackenzie Vega) will die.  But why have these two men been chosen and are they telling the truth?<br /><br />In a parallel story, Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) is on the hunt for the notorious "Jig-Saw Killer" after a run-in with the masked man doesn't go his way.  It's a match of wits as the time ticks down for him as well as the two prisoners.<br /><br />Wan and Whannel crank up the suspense with only a couple scares, but they are surprising and well-executed.  This by no means detracts from the movie's creepy, industrial art-house look they were going for.  This is not so much a horror film as it is a suspense/crime thriller.  On a "shoe string" $1 million dollar budget, the movie is a masterwork and made with a nice grisly quality.  For first time makers and this limited budget, the end result doesn't show any signs of limitations.  Some seasoned vets don't make movies that look this good with this much attitude.  One can tell that these two men really believe in their debut.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes are the flashbacks of the killer's victims.  Try not cringe as Amanda (Dena Meyer) is given just minutes to disembowel a living man in order to find the key in his stomach that will unlock her "reverse-beartrap" helmet or else have her jaws ripped clean off.  It's the few insanley twisted moments like this that really place SAW a cut above the rest.  Be warned, the violence isn't the most ever put on film that's for sure, but it is Rated R for strong grisly violence and language, and little is left to the imagination.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? Perhaps even 3.5?  Well, though the movie is well-made, original, and somewhat shocking, the acting, especially by its lead, Cary Elwes, is a bit campy and unbelieveable.  Maybe that's the fault of the director and writer? It isn't all terrible, but he fumbles just enough for it to become noticeable as some scenes play off as funny when they're definitely not supposed to.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid debut with plenty of jolts to keep your glued to your seat for just over an hour and a half.  It's disturbing, inventive, and for once, THE FINAL TWIST PAYS OFF BIG TIME!!!  Believe me, first-time viewers will not be disappointed and will find it surprisingly simple.  Perhaps that's why some people don't like the twist?  That's because they were fooled by something that was right in front of their eyes the whole time.  It's a great one nonetheless, and in my opinion, worth checking out.  I don't know what SAW 2 holds in store, and I doubt it will be nearly as good as its predecessor, but Wan and Whannel have made their impact.  I look forward to their upcoming projects because of their style and bold approach to the genre.
I went to go see SAW with high expectations and thought I'd leave the theatre with chills!!<br /><br />..That's not the case. Although it gets off to a good start and does have its creepy moments (such as the elaboration on the situations of the Jigsaw Killer's victims)and the moment where the saws are discovered... But what ultimately killed this movie for me was the horrible acting displayed by the actor playing the doctor (one of the victims trapped). That and the fact that (***SPOILER***) there were two instances where the kidnapper could've easily been killed...those two scenes I found utterly ridiculous because the victims allowed the killer to live.<br /><br />Just don't set your expectations high for this kind of film. The acting's cringe-wrothy, as is the car-chasing scene with Danny Glover and the Jigsaw Killer's apprentice..
When I went to go see "Saw" late last night I was thinking "saw" as the past tense of see and not "saw" as the noun ("a hand or power tool or a machine used to cut hard material and equipped usually with a toothed blade or disk") or as the verb ("to cut with a saw"). What was I thinking? "Saw" is in the Grand Guignol of "Seven" and "The Bone Cutter," and apparently had to make some last minute cuts to avoid getting saddled with a NC-17 rating. That alone with give you an indication of what first time director James Wan and first time writer Leigh Whannell were going for in "Saw," even with only $1.2 million to make the film and 18 days to shoot it.<br /><br />Adam (Leigh Whannell), a young man, wakes up underwater in a dark room with a chain around his ankle. He is not alone, and when the light come on he finds himself is what appears to be a long abandoned public restroom. At the other end is Lawrence (Cary Elwes), who is also chained to a pipe. On the floor in between them, out of their reach, is the corpse of a man who apparently killed himself with a gun. In his hand is a tape recorder. After becoming oriented to his strange surroundings, Adam discovers a plastic bag in his pocket, containing an envelope. Inside is a key and a small cassette tape with the words "Play Me." Let the game begin.<br /><br />Beyond that you really do not want to know that much about this before you see it, and given the dreck that passes for horror thrillers in recent years "Saw" is worth the seeing in the theater. The last time I actually went to see a film in this genre in a theater was probably "Hannibal," and I have not had any reason to regret being selective in this regard. However, this is not going to be a date movie, but one for hardcore fans of the genre who prefer their DVD editions to be the director's unrated cut of the film. "Saw" is a film that works more in the world of horror films than it does in the real world, but that is certainly part for the genre at this point.<br /><br />The entire film does not take place in the abandoned restroom, although that is main arena. Lawrence knows something about the "Jigsaw Killer," who has been constructing elaborate dances of death in which his victims have to try and save themselves. Only one victim has survived to date (Shawnee Smith), so it is possible to get out of this alive, just extremely difficult and we are treated to a couple of examples of where it did not go as well. Investigating the case are a couple of detectives, Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), and the chronology of the film gets skewed as the present and the past become confused. The game also involves more than the two men chained to the wall, because Lawrence's wife, Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter, Diana (Makenzie Vega) are part of it as well.<br /><br />During the film's endgame things are moving fast enough that you probably will not be able to figure out how it will all play out even though "Saw" overplays the obvious red herring card. The film pushes one of my least favorite buttons a couple of time, which is when somebody has a gun on the villain and does not blow them away. If there is one thing we have learned from all of these movies it is that hesitating when you have the bad guy in your sights is never a good thing. I especially go through the roof when a trained law enforcement officer is pointing the gun right at the killer and the killer still gets away (even Clarice Starling is guilty of this sin in "The Silence of the Lambs"). So there is some heavy handedness to Whannell's script that hopefully will be replaced by something more elegant when he and Wan make their recently announced "Saw 2" sequel for 2005.<br /><br />But "Saw" is not an elegant horror film, although Wan gets points for keeping the most horrific moment of the film off screen (even though the rationale is small budget and not true aesthetic choice, which makes me fearful for what will happen when Wan and Whannell have a much bigger budget for the sequel). The "Jigsaw Killer" has a warped interest in having his victims better appreciate their lives, so getting out alive has to do not only with Lawrence and Adam solving the tasks they are given, but also with finding out some important things about each other. The important thing here is that the film's final scene is pretty horrific, even if the film cheats a bit to get to that point, and that even when the screen goes dark and the credits start to roll, Whannell keeps the horror going.
Don't verbally abuse this film because it outsmarted you and you actually DIDN'T see the twist at the end coming from a mile off.  This was wonderfully original (with the one esception of Se7en, which also was wonderfully original, and therefore makes this one wonderfully original as wee) The acting wasn't bad, and the score was excellent (thanks to the brilliance of NIN's Charlie Clouser) and the "reverse beartrap", while over-theatrical in appearance, is something I would like to see happen to someone... But thats beside the point.  All in all, it was a pretty good movie, at least spend the $3 to rebt it.
When I first heard the concept several months ago, I was left under the impression that this was a one-room, high-octane character drama in the same vein as the wonderful CUBE. Very excited, I was.<br /><br />Obviously the trailer reveals that it's not all set in the same filthy subterranean room, but I saw this on opening night, without exposure to the marketing, so my expectations were high.<br /><br />Adam and Lawrence wake up chained to the pipes on either side of an anonymous bathroom, with a dead body sprawled between them. They soon come to learn (through the cassettes addressed to each of them and the dictaphone in the dead man's hand) that they are the latest victims of the 'killer' the media has dubbed Jigsaw. Serial sadist and morbid genius, Jigsaw drugs and abducts individuals who he deems worthy of participation in his experiments. He places people in suitably ironic kill or be killed situations. Either Adam kills Lawrence, Lawrence kills Adam, or they're left there to rot together.<br /><br />The story is told in a series of expository flashbacks, revealing characters and their contrived relationships piece by piece. Heralding plot twist after plot twist, each one more convoluted than the last.<br /><br />In order to facilitate the showcasing of the numerous elaborate deaths that befell Jigsaw's previous victims, we are presented with a totally superfluous cop character (Danny Glover). A man whose obsessive desire to apprehend Jigsaw and avenge his partner has cost him his job. A walking genre clich&eacute;, basically.<br /><br />What struck me as most odd was the direction during the death scenes. The camera sweeps 360 degrees around the room, edited into a hyperkinetic seizure, and thrash metal plays while the victims attempt to escape their predicament in super-fast motion. It's weird. Not to mention totally contrary to the mood inherent to that gloomy, psychotic subject matter. (However, the scene involving the reverse bear-trap and the key in the dead man is brilliantly realised, I admit.)<br /><br />The film is gorier, louder and less intelligent than SE7EN (to which it owes its existence), and has brought the cycle of 'serial killers with gimmicks' movies - that Fincher's masterpiece started and THE BONE COLLECTOR was thought to have limply concluded - to its ridiculous, overblown nadir. I can't conceive of someone reacting with anything other than a groan when they throw that one final pathetic twist at you - evidently they are, though. It's getting rave reviews.
After consecutively watching the entire Saw series over a recent weekend (and LOVING it), I decided that a single review with modified details could be used for all the films.  Enjoy.<br /><br />A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.<br /><br />Saw ONE begins with THREE people trapped in an abandoned BATHROOM.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John "Jigsaw" Kramer) game, ADAM STANHEIGHT (Leigh Whannell) and DR. LAWRENCE GORDON (Cary Elwes) have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), DET. STEVEN SING (Len Leung), and rugged veteran DAVID TAPP (Danny Glover) are investigating as a team, but DAVID TAPP may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participants learn that ADAM may be an accomplice to their abduction, and their situation provides a choice between a SAW AND A LEG or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead the captives (aka life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.<br /><br />Several previous murderous contraptions like the RAZOR WIRE MAZE (for a CUTTER), and the NAPALM/POISON/GLASS ROOM (for a HYPOCHONDRIAC) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the REVERSE BEAR TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S MIND, and on to Saw II.<br /><br />Jason Elin
This movie isn't as good as some past mind @%*% movies, but it definately is worth a look at.<br /><br />The ending is twisted.<br /><br />I understand that Saw 2 is coming out.
Can't believe I'm the first person to review this film... I really don't know what to think.  It's one of those movies that when it is over you think "now why didn't I pay more attention the first time."  Without giving the ending away I did wonder about this one character..... Don't think I'd ever watch it again.  Frankly I prefer Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers to this one.  Very gory and hard to follow the story line.  Probably this movie is for viewers under the age of 30 that are used to modern day gore.  Sorry!
The movie did have a few good scenes, yet I found the ending unsatisfying and even disappointing and also, there are some obvious inconsistencies in the story line.
Two men awaken to find themselves chained to thick metal piping at the opposite ends of an old abandoned bathroom. Adam (Leigh Whannell) is a photographer; Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, The Princess Bride) is a surgeon. Both men have no idea how they ended up in this room together. Nor how a dead body laying between them got there. In the dead body's hands are a gun and a micro-cassette tape player.<br /><br />They soon discover a micro-cassette tape in each of their pockets, and quickly uncover a creepy message that awaits them by their captor. The "jigsaw" killer has caught them: a psychopath who doesn't necessarily "kill" people, but helps them kill themselves . . . or survive by killing others.<br /><br />**********************************************************************<br /><br />The psychology surrounding the events is sound enough: the slow descent into suspicion of each other, the lack of external stimulation that leads to a decline in mental faculties, and the eventual near insanity that would insue if you found out you had to kill someone in order to save yourself and/or your loved ones. Do they deserve to die anymore than you do?<br /><br />Where this film fell a bit short was in acting and plot. The acting was subpar. Cary Elwes, who I absolutely LOVED in The Princess Bride, here comes off like an amateur (could be that they were pressed for time and money, filming on a budget of $1.2 million and in 18 days). Makenzie Vega, Elwes' wife in the film, was flat, uncharming, and a bore. As were the estimable Danny Glover (Grand Canyon), and Ken Leung (Rush Hour and Red Dragon).<br /><br />There were also enough plot holes to make this film resemble swiss cheese. There was the fact that the main antagonist turns out to be someone who could NEVER have pulled off such cases (mainly because he was deathly ill); Dr. Gordon was allowed to sit and watch the interrogation of a survivor of the Jigsaw Murderer (which NEVER would have happened if, as the film shows us, Dr. Gordon was an initial suspect); the "game" that is played out by this killer is given to the captives bit by bit, as if it were a simple video game and all you had to do to survive was to put the pieces together. But, what I didn't understand, is that if this psycho enjoyed watching people tear themselves or others apart, why would he give them a way out, with simple clues and instructions? Didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />For the horror fan, though, I'm sure this film will be coveted and hailed as a great film of 2004. For me, though, it's a pretty big disappointment.
Sometimes the mind has tunnel vision. But details need to be ingrained.<br /><br />"Saw" is a no bones, graphic crime thriller. Knowing that going into view this film can only lead to predictable assumptions. Who is the Killer? That question is always in the viewer's mind. As a side note: Your first instinct is usually right!<br /><br />Director James Wan plays with those viewer's assumptions. "Saw" is about a sadistic serial killer with a conscience on changing his victim's outlook. This is a great story with many twists and options to play with as a scriptwriter. Will you make a drastic decision to save your life?<br /><br />"Saw" starts out with a great premise but ends with the believable factor. How much time would it take to set up these elaborate scenarios with life choice decisions?  The plot is intertwined in massive coincidence of circumstances. The inept detectives (Danny Glover/Ken Leung) round out the mislead manhunt.  Hopefully the sequel will be better. But worth viewing to find out who is the killer!
Playing like an "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" on speed, "Saw" is a no holds barred terror ride that lets you know right away anything can and probably will happen.<br /><br />The title "Saw" comes from the name "Jigsaw", the name given to the serial killer who actually does not kill his victims, but instead finds ways to get them to kill themelves by placing them in scenarios by which if they do not perform certain tasks -- they will die.<br /><br />A sample scenario: A mechanical vice has been strapped to your head.  Similar to a large bear trap that works in reverse, you need to get this thing off your head in 60 seconds or when it goes off -- it'll rip your head apart.  Sounds simple, right?  Oh, did I mention the key to unlock the trap is in the stomach of the man lying on the floor in front of you?<br /><br />Yeah... it's that twisted.<br /><br />A must see for any self repsecting horror film fan.
First off, I am a film maker, for the most part a horror/suspense film maker. I love when movies like "Saw" are released simply because it gives a twist on todays film indistry. I must say, seeing the trailer for "Saw" the first time, I thought it looked like another slash em up movie on a first date kind of level, but was I ever wrong! "Saw" is an absolute miraclous film. I was amazed by it. In the beggining I admit it seems like a pointless reason to throw blood around, but give it time, it starts to get good and twisted fast. This was director James Wan's debut and I must say I am right proud of this young man. The movie is superb in every way except its acting. I'm sorry, I apoligiese to those who are true critics because the acting in this movie is not all that believable, yet the movie itself makes up for it. I would have to recomend this movie to every horror fan out there, but be warned, not for the faint of heart. But all in all you should find yourself guessing, sweating, breathing heavier, and wide eyed from first frame to the masterpiece of a twist. The best twist since "The Sixth Sense" no lie. "Saw" is a great film and if only its acting was imrpoved this would limp away with an easy **** 4 stars. From Horror/Suspense Writer/Director Matt M. Thank you.
Wow!  Very few times I get suprised, especially in the horror genre.  Then out of nowhere comes a movie that leaves me breathless.  Intense, gory, thrilling, and complex.  This film has it all.  It is like "Se7en" meets "Hannibal."  This movie is twisted, even sick at times.  Just when I thought I knew whats going on, bam!  A new twist.  The ending is top notch.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Well worth seeing twice, to see if you can pick up clues that were missed the first time.  I see a sequel is in the future, hell this could be a new franchise.  Move over Freddy, Chucky and Jason.  There's a new killer in town, and he's smart.  A highly charged thriller well worth the time.
This movie was very run of the mill. Unless you still think speeding up the camera and fast editing are cutting edge, It reminds me of recent MTV videos. The worst part was the acting, I love the princess bride guy (Cary Elwes) but man was he bad, to his credit some of the lines he was given were absurd. The Writer of the movie (who played opposite him) was actually pretty good, but i guess its becuase i knew he wasnt a real actor so i gave him some slack.<br />The movie starts out good enough, but it never ever hit the stride that told me it was going to be a hit, or even a cult hit. Maybe i should have given it 3 stars but i gave it 2 because i had to counter all those people who gave it 5 stars (The Godfather deserves 5 stars, not SAW!)<br />Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd could easily have been cast.<br />Oh, And i do get the point of the movie, although it still does not help.
what would you do if you wake up in a room, chained to a pipe, with a dead guy that blew his brains out in the middle. Meet Lawerence and Adam, they wind up in a really bad bathroom, with only no clue of how they got there. They try to piece together the clues and find out who would put them in that bathroom. The only way they can escape is by cutting their foot off.<br /><br />good movie, good directing, mediocore acting, and a interesting screenplay
Simply put, Saw is the best horror movie I've seen in years.  I know some people don't seem to like it, but this horror fan is just wallowing in the bloody effectiveness of this extremely dark, intelligent, gory masterpiece of a film.  It's such a thrill to see something certifiably different make its way to movie screens; these days, Hollywood horror filmmakers have gotten so lazy that they can't even make sequels of films - instead, they just remake old horror films that don't need remaking.  Frankly, I'm a little tired of watching teenagers get slashed up in the woods by rednecks and inbred mutants.  I want something new, something fresh, something bold, something ruthless in its execution, something that engages my intellect while assaulting my senses.  Saw fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />As Saw moves toward its gory denouement, it unleashes a number of great surprises, and the ending is well-nigh perfect - I certainly didn't see it coming.  You may think you know what is going on, but I'll wager that you'll be mistaken.  Best of all, there's no deus ex machina plot device to ruin everything - i.e., as surprising as the final revelations are, everything comes together in a heartbeat to make perfect sense.  I really can't say enough about the script put together by Leigh Wannell and James Wan - it's bloody brilliant.  I love this movie.<br /><br />The Bad Man in Saw is downright sadistic; rather than merely hunt his victims down and kill them himself, he creates elaborate "games" that lead to painful deaths brought about by the participants themselves.  He chooses his victims carefully, selecting only those who are guilty of some "crime" or indiscretion that he feels should no longer go unpunished (and when one former victim won the game, he did in fact let her go - and in one twisted sense, she was better off as a result of having played the game).  The particular game at the centerpiece of the film (which is actually rather mundane compared to some of the killer's previous ones) pits two men together in a filthy underground room and challenges one player to kill the other within a certain time limit if he wants to keep his wife and daughter alive.  That would be Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes); his partner in torturous suffering is a young fellow named Adam (Leigh Wannell).  Both of them wake up in this room without knowing where they are or how they got there.  Our imaginative dark lord of sadism provides the two with some hidden clues and "tools" that do much to keep things really interesting.  Did I mention both men are chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room, and that there's a bloody dead guy lying in the middle of the floor?  Oh, how I wish I could tell you more about what happens, but I wouldn't dare deprive any Saw virgins out there from truly enjoying this magnificent film.<br /><br />I must admit that I expected to see nothing but gore in this movie - mindless, bloody gore.  Certainly, there's gore all over the place, but this is the exact opposite of a mindless thriller.  Yet again, a small-budget film has far surpassed the best horror films Hollywood has to offer, proving once more that a strong and intelligent plot, not gore in and of itself, is the secret for succeeding in this darkest of genres.  Saw is truly a horror film for the ages, the first true horror masterpiece of the 21st century.
There are not words to describe how bad Saw was. Horrific, and not in the scary sense. Hideous. Abysmal. Those merely skim the surface. Where to start?<br /><br />The Acting: Cary Elwes should turn in his SAG card; the groveling and whining and sobbing just made me embarassed for him. Leigh Whannell did a marginally better job than Cary, surprisingly, but that didn't make it good.  He was horribly wooden and unbelieveable thoroughout most of the movie.<br /><br />Plot: The plot could have been great.  It was certainly a great concept, but the execution was just awful.  The flashback scenes were repetitive and eventually became monotonous - especially when it got to the point of nesting flashbacks within flashbacks. The police procedure in the movie was so ludicrously unbelieveable that no suspension of disbelief was possible.  The relationship between Elwes' character (Lawrence) and his wife was one dimensional and, again, poorly acted.  And Elwes' scenes with his daughter were schmaltzy and played in a sing-songy voice that grated.<br /><br />The *only* redeeming scene in the movie was the jaw-trap scene. It was suspensful and horrifying - if you skip past the VH1 video on speed part.<br /><br />I really wish I could write more, but there's nothing more to write.  I supposed I could say it was a good effort for an Indie film, but I've seen Indie films that rocked my world, so that's no excuse.  There just are no other words.
MOVIE: Wow, what a horrible movie.  I really mean it.  I haven't seen a movie so bad in such a long time.  An interesting premise and a very well put trailer would lead you to believe that this movie follows in the footsteps of Se7en.  Let me tell you how much of a joke this movie is.  Well, here is the plot, two guys wake up in a bathroom chained up to the wall and are being tormented by the Jigsaw killer.  A madman who actually gets the victims to kill themselves.  Interesting? Yeah it is. So what wen't wrong? Well the number one problem here was the acting, oh my god the acting.  I am going to say it here and now that this movie had some of the worst acting I have ever seen in my life. That goes for you too Danny Glover, shame on you.  You wanna know how bad the acting was? The acting was so bad that the entire audience was laughing at the film's climax, which was supposed to be the tensest scene in the movie.  The dialogue was so utterly horrible, so laughable. This movie follows the same goddamn formula that every psychological thriller does, except here there is absolutely no point to it.  Every psychologocal thriller has a "big twist" at the end, it's a must, but when the twist is the stupidest thing in the movie that has no connection to any of the characters then your movie has failed.  I didn't guess the ending, I knew it was coming, but I didn't figure it out.  The only reason I didn't figure it out was that there were no clues for the audience to pick off of, the plot is so literal and meaningless that they forgot to throw in the meaningful dialogue and visuals. There is only one scene in the movie that would allow you to figure out the ending, but the way it was done was so the filmmaker's made sure that the audience wouldn't pick up on it.  When I go see a thriller I want the filmmakers to outsmart and outwit me so I get a big slap in the face when the end comes and I say to myself "my god why didn't I see that in the first place".  Saw is a case where the filmmakers are too stupid to make a witty and clever plot so they fill it up with gore.  When a movie has a scene where a guy trips on a wire to trigger 6 shotguns to fire onto his head you know that the filmmakers are too stupid to come up with anything else.  This was the biggest joke I have ever seen and I am pissed at myself for going into this movie thinking it would be good.  I'm pissed because I know that the movie's marketing campaign worked on me and I fell victim to it.<br /><br />ACTING: You would see better acting from a blind mime.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Not scary, not disturbing, not fun to watch.  The audience knows exactly where the plot is going except they will have no idea who the killer is because the filmmakers won't allow it, that way they are sure that its a surprise for the audience at the end.  Okay you got the surprise, now what's the purpose? The only scary thing about this movie is the plot and acting.  Not once did I jump, not once was I questioning what will happen, not once was I impressed. If you haven't seen Se7en, then I beg of you to see it. Please see Se7en instead of this meaningless piece of crud.
This is the perfect example of Hollywood's inability to no longer generate an original thought. This is just a culmination of 12 other movies, one that was good, some that were mediocre, some that were, well, not so good, but the end result is one of the worst movies ever made, it sucked. First off the whole feeling of the film is of one of those low budget, straight to video, serial killer, B movies. The lighting, anywhere else but the bathroom sucked, the acting was below par and frankly sucked, the short 45 sec. car chase scene, was one of the cheapest, cheesiest scenes I've ever seen in my entire life and frankly the editor and the director should be ashamed for having it in the finished product. I mean, just because you shoot a guy in a car with high speed film and make them move around so the finished product is herky jerky and chaotic looking, does not mean that its a cheaper alternative thats just as good, it in fact means that you've achieved to project yet another B grade effect, lending an amateurish prose for your film.<br />The only reason that I gave this movie even a star, was because it does have a surprise ending. Not a thought provoking one like Se7en, which is thought invoking on many moral and ambiguous levels (which I think this director really tried to unsuccessfully imulate), no its just one of those endings where you go, "Oh," and move one with your life and don't give it another thought, unless your retarded and in which case you'll still be talking about it a week after you saw it (in which case you'll inadvertantly talk thousands of intelligent people into watching this (...). This film not only took 2 hours of my life that I will never get back, along with my $3.50 it took to rent it, it also took several IQ points that I would very much like to get back. Now there's an idea for a movie, retarded hollywood directors make crappy films to suck IQ points from viewers, it could be a documentary, not a fictional account, 'cause its happening right now!!!<br />I really can't tell you why I even picked this up off the shelf at rental place. Guess I just wanted a little escapism. Well I didn't even get that. But I'll tell you what I did get, one lame ass movie.
Saw (James Wan, 2004)<br /><br />The people who are criticizing Saw because Cary Elwes' acting ability breaks down at the end (which is an inaccurate statement in the first place, but oh well) are probably the same ones who criticize Se7en because of Brad Pitt's infamous "what's in the baaaaahhhhhhx?"line. Consider that when trying to decide whether you're going to see it.<br /><br />Saw is the best psychological thriller in years, perhaps since Radha Bharadwaj unleashed the most underrated film of all time, Closetland, on us in 1991. The story concerns a mysterious sadist, known as Jigsaw (because of a distinctive mark left on those whose lives he touches), who cooks up inventive ways for people to kill themselves and applies them to those whose wasted lives they fit with most appropriately. Even saying that much really constitutes a spoiler, explaining how the movie works would be even more of one.<br /><br />I find it all too amusing that the pre-release reviews of the film were overall positive (before it opened, its tomatometer reading at the indispensable Rotten Tomatoes site was 86%) and post-release reviews have been overall negative (as I write this, it sits at 46%). What's even more interesting is that so many of these reviews harp on the gore factor. The movie had two full minutes trimmed in order to get its R rating. I'm still wondering why. Aside from a few uses of the one word guaranteed to give your movie an R rating (cf. the brilliant horror spoof Student Bodies), only one scene in that movie would barely rate above a PG-13, were I voting; aside from that scene, there's nothing in this movie you won't see in an episode of CSI or The Shield. Most of you won't need to hide your eyes, except in one scene. (Close them at the words "Hello, Amanda," and keep them closed for approximately the next three minutes.)<br /><br />As I read through the reviews for this movie, I wonder if they all missed the point. I keep seeing the word "scary," usually in a negative connotation (as in, the word "not" is before it). People, Saw is not a horror film. Se7en was not scary, either, nor was Closetland. The whole point of the movie, as with any mystery, is to lead up to the main plot twist, where you figure out whodunit. And in that regard, Saw excels like no movie since The Usual Suspects. In fact, were it not for that film, I'd have started this review with the words "Best. Ending. Ever." As it stands, it runs a pretty close second.<br /><br />Since so many people in so many places are harping on the acting, this seems a good time to bring it up. Yeah, there's some below-par acting here, especially from Makenzie Vega (The Geena Davis Show), who often seems more like a robot than a girl. Elwes does his job well; what I assume people are talking about when they say "his acting abaility breaks down at the end" is actually about an hour into the movie, when he really starts getting mad. Yeah, it's kind of amusing, and certainly not tense, but then I'm not sure it was meant to be. (If you're really criticizing him for his acting at the end of the movie, I'm wondering if we saw the same movie, or if you realized what condition he was supposed to be in. His acting at the actual end of the film was spot on.) Excellent supporting performances are turned in by screenwriter Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, and a number of others. Special attention should be paid to Shawnee Smith, who's miles away from her amusingly bad performance in the 1988 remake of The Blob. Monica Potter makes appearances, but mostly in the film's weakest moments; she's not really given enough to work with to see what she's capable of.<br /><br />I really wonder if the people who reviewed this film before I got around to it really saw the same movie I did. Maybe they were all lucky enough to see the uncut version. Maybe they're just not used to seeing suspense films that contain gore (which would actually explain a lot of the seeming misinterpretation). Go see it without any preconceptions, expecting a mystery/suspense thriller rather than a horror film, and you will be mighty entertained. **** . Originally a ****, but half a point got added for the movie's last two minutes.
AND ONCE AGAIN DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CHEAP SCARE HORROR FANS WHO DO NOT LIKE TO USE THEIR BRAINS TO THINK! DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE POOR REVIEWS! THIS IS A GREAT SCARY MOVIE! A CRAZED KILLER CAPTURES PEOPLE AND TRIES TO FORCE THEM TO KILL ONE ANOTHER! I WOULD COMPARE THIS TO SILENCE OF THE LAMBS AND SEVEN! THE ACTING IS INCREDIBLE, AND THE STORY IS VERY ORIGINAL AS WELL! THIS IS ANOTHER FANGO SEAL OF APPROVAL FROM THE NUMBER ONE HORROR MAG, FANGORIA! THIS IS ANOTHER CLASSIC FOR THE ART HOUSE HORROR FANS! FOR THE REST OF YOU THRILLED BY CHEAP SCARES AND WOODEN CHARACTERS, I HEAR VAN HELSING CALLING YOU! FIVE STARS FOR SAW! GIVE IT THE BIG TEN STARS IF I COULD! DON'T LISTEN TO THE SCREAM FANS! IF YOU LIKE REAL GROWN UP DISTURBING HORROR MOVIES, THEN SAW IS DEFINITLY WORTH SEEING!
who cares it got 48% in rottentomatoes?<br /><br />great film<br /><br />good story line<br /><br />you will never find out what happen in the end<br /><br />but If you watch this film again<br /><br />it might not be entertainment as first time<br /><br />but you might find some interesting scene
I originally bought the whole series for our son because he said Saw was a great movie.  I dont like "bloody" movies but this does have plot.  More like a "moral of the story" plot.<br /><br />Teresa<br />Kernersville NC
Two men are chained up in the bathroom of a filthy abandoned building. They don't know where they are or why, but they do know that one of them has to kill the other in order to live. As their ordeal progresses, secrets leak out, tying the men to one another, and to the man known as the Jigsaw Killer, who punishes those who are insensitive to others, who prey on their weaknesses. A haunting thriler with many twists and turns, as well as a rich character study about the nature of sin, redemption, voyeurism and the inhumanity that we all are guilty of just by going through our everyday lives mindlessly.
Very rarely do horror movie franchises work. Usually the original film is well-written and scary, but most Hollywood producers make sequels to make money with mediocre scripts and untalented actresses juggling their upper portions of their bodies to be discovered. However, the "Saw" series of films are all freightening, hair-raiing, fast paced, involving, and, blood-curdling. The plot is simple: a psychopath named Jigsaw kidnaps people who take their lives for granted and puts them in torture chambers to see who can escape. The "Saw" films are not for the faint of heart, so if you have a weakness for gore these are not for you to view. But, if you want good horror that will scare you out of your seat watch the "Saw" films. I can't say I have a particular version I like the best, for all the sequels are well produced and follow the same formula as the original. As of 2010 there have been six "Saw" films, usually being released to theatres the week before Halloween. The latest "Saw" film, unfortunately, was not as successful as its predecessors.
Well, for starters I can say it is one of the best franchises ever, not only because the "killer" has a real good motive for "killing" people, and it isn't like most of the genres were the killer is "just insane" and does it just for "fun"...also, no matter how well you think you have figured out the genre you will have a lot of surprises in all the movies of SAW, for me its simply one of the best movies ever and if you have a chance to see the other ones you wont get disappointed, but I have to say that they are more of the "gore genre" than the scary genre... never the less still a great movie franchise. I highly recommend them.
This is a superb horror film. Spawning multiple sequels, the original is still the best. Horror films are often over looked by award givers in part to the genre in general- most "award" films are more drama films.<br />This isn't some European horror trip leaving you confused, and searching for the meaning to the film. And it isn't the squirting blood fest that many "horror" films are. This is a well thought out film- relying on plot and acting, rather than CGI or over the top gore.<br />Excellent film- rent it first if you like, but buy it too. Five stars all the way. -If you like Se7en, Hostel, Jaws, or Zodiac, check this film out.
All I have to say going to say, is it was the first film to make me cringe in a long while, from something other then wondering whos' rear hollywood has it's head stuck in. Gory it's true but with a method to the madness, and  a twisting plaot that only a fewe have mentioned they figured out before the film had finnished. I loved it.
Definitely one of the smartest and best thriller in history.<br />This movie proves that a good story and good script is far more important<br />than a good budget (only $1 million).<br />All the suspense, gruesome, witty elements are in the highest standard in<br />movie standard.<br />Truly a must for not-so-easily-fainted.
After countless raves from nearly every one of my horror film loving friends, I decided one day it was time for me to watch "Saw," an indie slasher film premiering at the Sundance Film Festival as one of the "Midnight Movies" that is widely considered one of the greatest horror films of its generation. In no way does this film disappoint, no matter what you are looking for in a film.<br /><br />Let's start with the story. Two young men--a doctor named Dr. Gordon, and a photographer named Adam--wake up chained to the wall in a dirty, old washroom. Neither of them know how they got there--and they don't know each other either. There is a slaughtered corpse between them eerily clutching a tape recorder and two tapes addressed to each of the men. The message is clear: one must find a way to kill the other by 6:00 that evening or they will both--along with Dr. Gordon's family--be killed.<br /><br />Before long, they realize they are now victims of the Jigsaw killer--a known serial killer who captures people who do not appreciate life and force them to hurt themselves or others in order to save themselves from a bloody, gruesome, brutal, torturous death. In a series of flashbacks, ze discover more about Jigsaw, and experience previous encounters his victims' have had. We learn of Gordon and Adam's past, an obsessed detective dedicated to finding Jigsaw, and a young drug addict named Amanda who survived Jigsaw's sick "games" and is now mentally scarred. As the story unfolds, it suddenly explodes into a brilliantly twisted psychological thriller that  will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll after the shock ending and even for some time after that. Lots of hardcore gore and an INCREDIBLY SCARY atmosphere accompany this much-above-average slasher flick.<br /><br />The acting is both great and dreadful at different times, but is always thoroughly realistic. Jigsaw is perfectly cast in his role. Adam was sort of an annoying character, but still managed to deliver, and Dr. Gordon seemed like some WAY overdramatic guy out of Star Trek, and was the only character in the small cast I was actually hoping to get killed.<br /><br />The directing and editing is absolutely nothing to rave about and is solely why I didn't give Saw 5 stars. The flashbacks are adequetly done, sometimes poorly, but unfortunately, for a super psychological horror film like Saw, that is a huge failure and deserves negative feedback. Very fortunately, the strong storyline and sheer terrifying simple atmosphere holds the film together.<br /><br />Overall--a very enjoyable movie watching experience, and it will scare the living daylights out of you if you watch it alone on a big screen with surround sound. Not one for the little kids however, as it is very violent in some select scenes (particularly the ending) but that shouldn't keep you from seeing it. Very good and much, much more and above and ultimately smarter and more brilliant the average super-violent slasher horror films that are out there today.
I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this infamous horror/gore movie. I can pretty much handle anything you can throw at me, but the title suggest I am going to see some really disturbing stuff! To my surprise, the movie has nowhere near the gore I thought it would have. This is a good thing and it is really more in the same vein as Se7en and Halloween etc. A good entry in the horror genre and much better than I expected. I liked the third installment, but I was not too impressed with the second one. If you must see a Saw then this is the Saw to see. ;-b
Somewhere in a dirty and uncleaned bathroom, two men named Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannel) are trapped as a cold-blooded maniac named Jigsaw whom captures his victims and makes them do deadly games involving life and death in order to survive. However, Dr. Gordon's family is in danger as he must do as he's told by Jigsaw to play a sadistic game of survival or else they die.<br /><br />Dark, gruesome, violent and smart psychological horror crime thriller with excellent acting especially by Danny Glover, Monica Porter, Michael Emerson and others. The direction by James Wan is very good as well as the script he wrote which is quite well written, this movie is an edge of your seat thrill ride that isn't for the faint of heart but for those brave enough to enjoy this movie. There's plenty of twists and turns throughout this movie that includes one scary looking puppet that the killer uses to terrorize his victims, there's also a nice twist at the end of this movie.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Uncut Unrated Special Edition has good picture and quality sound with the movie being shown in it's unrated version with footage that was trimmed down to avoid an "NC-17" rating. The extras include two audio commentaries, the original shortfilm "Saw" that inspired this movie, behind the scenes featurette, alternate storyboard sequence, and more.

With an unoriginal script full of plot holes, a limited budget, cheesy acting, and a twist (though a cop-out) ending, SAW could have been another washed-up horror movie. Instead, it became the surprise horror hit of 2004, birthed a new killer icon--the Jigsaw Killer, prompted two sequels (so far), earned over $100 million worldwide, and revived the movie career of Cary Elwes.<br /><br />The film opens in a disgusting, dirty, disused, and probably diseased bathroom with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) chained at opposite ends of the room to pipes by their ankles with an apparent dead man lying between them.  The dead guy holds a tape player and a handgun and each of the men has a tape in their back pocket.  They each play their tapes: one is threatened, but the other isn't.  Dr. Gordon must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and daughter will die.  The men discover hacksaws in a toilet, but fail to cut through their chains.  Time is running out.  Meanwhile, Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) is hunting Jigsaw as the movie flashbacks to scenes showing some of Jigsaw's other victims.  Jigsaw wears a giant puppet head and he never actually kills his victims himself.  Instead, he forces them to kill themselves or to kill each other, the whole time watching his little "game" which he believes is a public service to set people free (think of a psychotic and murderous Tyler Burden from FIGHT CLUB).  Put it all together and it makes for one bizarre movie.<br /><br />Personally, I found SAW to be better than I had expected it to.  The idea of a gamemaster who doesn't actually kill anyone himself but lets them do what he wants them to, is an interesting concept.  Danny Glover is a pleasure to watch on film and it was nice to see Cary Elwes again, even if his performance was terrible.  There's a lot of blood and guts in the film, though much of it has been toned down through editing and lighting, yet there are some things that the filmmakers leave up to one's imagination.<br /><br />Overall, even though SAW is pretty much an average horror flick, it has enough sparks of originality to make it one cut above the rest.
I think this movie is very interesting in two ways.<br /><br />Firstly, every one of us can be the victim of the "jigsaw". The characters in this movie were captured by the "jigsaw" because of the mistakes which they committed in the past.?Everybody makes mistakes and tend to dismiss the importance of one's precious life.<br /><br />Secondly, everyone can be the "jigsaw". Violence depicted on this film makes us feel very badly, but sometimes you find yourself being in empathy with the violent character.<br /><br />This movie is very violent and aggressive, but it makes us think about the importance of life.
These two guys wake up chained up on opposite ends of a dirty utility room.  Whoever chained them up was brilliant, because the hand saw they are given doesn't cut through metal, but goes through flesh and bone.  They wonder why they're there.  One is calmer than the other.  In the room with them, there's a dead body, and in each of the hands there is a tape player and a handgun.  The two guys each have a tape with instructions on what to do in order to stay alive.  The madman behind all this is nicknamed Jigsaw, and he put his victims in these situations so to show them how precious life is.  In his eyes, people are killing themselves with drugs and whatnot that they don't take time to appreciate their own lives and what they got.  As the movie goes on, we, the audience find out information on the two guys.  One of the guys is a doctor and doesn't spend enough time at home with his wife and daughter.  The other is a photographer who, throughout the movie, we find out that he's been secretly taking pictures of the doctor.<br /><br />This movie isn't as scary as I thought it would have been, but it is pretty disturbing and intense.  I'm pretty good at watching blood, but when the part where he had to saw his own leg off to free himself from the chain, I had to cover my eyes.  This movie made me think a lot.  Life is too short, and this movie will tell you to savor each breath you take.
I love this movie. It messed me up just as bad if not worse than the first Saw! I wasn't expecting what I saw in it.
Saw is a must see for any fan of horror movies. I've been hard-pressed to find a truly horrifying horror movie over the last few years, and finally they give us Saw. It was worth the wait. It's mentally thrilling as well as full of gore, particularly if you get the uncut version, which I wish I'd waited for but I'm just too impatient. The uncut version has a cooler cover but it also has more gore to it. After viewing the uncut version (which my best friend has) it was easy to see why they cut some of those scenes to make it more movie-friendly for those who are too squeamish. You'll have a lot of fun trying to figure out the game in this movie, and when the ending comes you'll be quite surprised. At least I was. I made my best friend check all my closets after this one, but if I told you why it would give away the ending. Not just recommended...mandatory for horror fans everywhere.
Somewhere between sheer fear and repulsive gore lies this movie racing against few others for the best horror film of 2004. If for some reason you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it.<br /><br />The premise is simple: Two men wake up to find themselves chained to metal pipes on oposite sides of a ridiculously large and open bathroom. They're the next "murder" cases for the Jigsaw killer. I'll keep this spoiler proof, and not go any further as to the guidelines they must obey in order to escape.<br /><br />The camera work in this movie is not complex, but it's exactly what was needed to convey the scenes.<br /><br />The ending twist is beautiful! Even if someone has been a jerk and ruined the ending for you, watch it anyway.
...but there was a healthy dose of suspense and enough twists to keep the viewer interested.<br /><br />What loses me is the title and cover, which I thought conveyed a more demented body chopping scenario. I expected to see some serial killer sawing up his victims, but that's not what this film is about. The saw doesn't come into play until the end, after being introduced in the beginning, at which time we assume what it's final use will be anyway. Another title and presentation should have been used to correctly convey the films personality.<br /><br />The saw is not the main focus, and certainly not the main tool of carnage in this clever film. Yes, I said clever. I cannot knock the originality, and freshness of this plot, but I think the title and cover do not do it justice. This is a great story with some good and bad acting, but overall a good thrill. It is deceiving. I'm actually surprised they made part two.<br /><br />People may come away unhappy because they expected one thing based on the name and packaging, yet got something completely different.
Saw is a pretty grotesque story yet had an intriguing story.  In the movie, Jigsaw kidnaps people and sets them up in things that force them to hurt themselves in order to escape, or else they die in some way.  The story of this movie is interesting, but it is pretty disgusting to me when the characters inflict pain on themselves.  That stuff just turns me off and I was very grossed out by this.  Other then that, if you don't mind that then you should like this movie a lot as it has a good story and a lot of gore.
This is a solid-situation thriller as they call it. However, it isn't one in the strict sense of the term as much of the story occurs outside the bathroom where those two chaps are held captive. Of the two it is only Lawrence who is ordered to kill the other, Adam, thus robbing the film of all the psychological interplay that would occur between the two were Adam also  ordered to kill the other, Lawrence. True, I did find myself on the edge of the seat at times, but I found it a bit difficult to identify with this demented mastermind whose motive can only be described as "infantile", and it is for this reason that all this preaching about "how ungrateful we are of the blessings" sounds decidedly hollow. This is in no way a bad film but I prefer Cube to this one as the Canadian thriller, based on the Cartesian/Kantian concept, has much more to offer both ethically as well as artistically.
I expected this to be just another slasher film with unnecessary nudity and people running upstairs instead of down. But, it's actually nothing like that surprisingly. This is a fresh feel to a horror movie, probably seen before, but hasn't been done to death over the past few years.<br /><br />The movie starts off a bit confusing, but you pick up on whats going on. It starts off showing the two main actors, already stuck in their prison that the villain has placed them in. They're locked in chains, have no idea how they got there and don't know what is going on. As it goes on, they find these sort of clues, and have to solve little riddles or something while a clock is running down. If they run out of time, pay the consequences. Also it follows a story of an ex-cop played by Danny Glover who is on the hunt for the "Jigsaw" killer. During the movie there are flashbacks to things the main actors are remembering from their pasts, trying to remember how they got into the situation they are in, what they had heard, who they thought it was, who they where etc...<br /><br />It's hard to say anything really without giving away the whole deal. So I'll just say, this an interesting movie because every-time you think you predict something, you don't! Plus it's interesting that the killers actions aren't murder, he puts his victim in a situation where if they want to live, they must make sacrifices to stay alive.
What can i say Saw is a brilliant film, an like many brilliant films it is also low budget..now don't let that put you off, because it is extremely entertaining. Cary Elwes, one of the lead actors was quite irritating though, and the over the top gore could have maybe been grunged down, but saw overall proves a fantastic treat
When's the last time we've seen a good, original horror film (other than The Ring)?  Still trying to think?  So am I.  At first, when the previews of Saw were hitting television, the movie looked to me like the kind of movie that really doesn't go anywhere, and has no actual plot, but boy was I wrong!  After reading review after review after review on message boards and websites of how good this movie was, I found myself at Suncoast paying for the DVD before I had even seen it, and let me tell you, my instincts did not fail me!  Saw was fantastic!  The twists, the plot itself, the setting, the suspense, everything seemed to have been mapped out perfectly.  Not to mention the film's few grisly moments which take it back to good old raw horror.  I notice a lot of directors out there say they tried to go back to good old school fun, but they never pull it off.  That wasn't the case here.  They kept the movie contemporary, but still managed to also keep it moving at a relatively easy pace, so you're able to keep up with what's going on while the suspence builds up on you.  That was a great credit on the director's part.  The only downside is the subpar acting.  However, you'll find yourself overlooking that in a hurry.  Saw is one of the best damn horror movies I have seen in a very long time.  Any true horror fan should enjoy it!
It was pretty good.  I would consider it more of a gory thriller, rather than horror.  Nevertheless, an entertaining movie, definitely worth the watch.  But, as with most u.s./canada releases, this was not the 'real' movie you want to watch.  Unfortunately, the original had to be edited so it could go down from nc-17 to R rating...yes, it was originally that gory.  None of us in the u.s. got to see the original uncut version, and even worse, its not even available on dvd....stateside!!  Luckily, our mates in the uk DID get to see the uncut version in their theatres, and its also available on dvd (region 2, PAL).  This is the one that you guys wanna see, this was the one that was meant to be released originally:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007LEJNQ/qid=1111053552/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-4620663-2158002
SAW has got to be one of the most underappreciated films to come out in theaters last year and I decided to rent this film last night and let me tell you something, this film is probably one of the most entertaining films I've seen in 05' and first time directer Wan' did a superb job making a film, which only took them 2 weeks to make.  AS FOR ACTING, yes it's not that great but not bad either....I thought Dr. Larwence ruined it with his acting.  Other then that this film was really, really awesome.<br /><br />People need to understand that this film was originally(suprisingly true!!)going to be a "DIRECT to Dvd and VHS film" but since it was praised by so many fans at those film festivals, they decided to put the film in theaters(sadly it was only in limited theaters in U.S).  Obviously the Director wanted it to go wide in theaters so he had to "butcher" the NC-17 raing so he could get his R rating.  Still this film is so highly enjoyable, especially for fans of the movie Se7ven.<br /><br />SAW is a great film, not so great acting, great twist(oh my oh my who saw that coming)though it's a bit flawed and I'm not going to explain why, just go on forums and you'll see.  Sadly SAW leaves you hanging with abunch of questions and even worse, SAW2 is already in the works and it's being directed by a different person so I already get that feeling that the sequal will have NOTHING to do with SAW1....Oh well...<br /><br />Go check out SAW....It's a really great film...<br /><br />4.0 out of 5 stars
This is one of the most original ideas of seen in any movie recently. A killer who teaches his victims the value of life through his sick and deadly games. I was intrigued with the ways the "Jigsaw Killer" was killing his victims. The ending surprised me greatly. My only complaint is that there's a lot of dialogue but though all that to see the violent scenes makes it worth your while.
When I was watching the movie I figured that it was like the rest of them until the ending came about. Putting yourself in the victims place is the freakiest thing. Its a definite worth watching as long as blood and gorey scenes do not bother you. The film is more of a pyschological thriller vs a horror movie. It is very similar to the movie SEVEN with brad pitt.
This move is really good. I thouhgt it was funnier than it was scary, but that's just my opinion. If you like gore and demented plot lines, this movie is for you. With one of the most (if not THE most) unpredictable endings, Saw is an excellent film... I don't want to give away any hints (this movie would definitely be best if you knew as little about it as possible), so I suggest seeing it yourself. My only complaint is the acting could have been better, but it's not bad enough to make it a bad movie.
There are so Many Thriller Movies out there today that it is hard to Distinguish One From Another! This is Not the case with SAW!FINALLY a Thriller that Really DELIVERS! Many People have Compared this Film To Seven. While I agree with that Assessment, I feel that Saw takes it up a notch and is even better than Seven.One Of The Strongest Points in this Film is that it isnt a Star Driven Movie, the biggest names in this Film are Danny Glover and Cary Elwes but the main Star of the Film is The Excellent Screenplay and the Mood that the Director sets. This Film is a Roller Coaster Ride From Start To Finish and the ending will Blow You Away, Trust Me, You Will NOT have Seen this Ending Coming. I dont want to go into details about the film because I dont want to give anything away but this Film is Well Worth Seeing! One Of The Best Thriller Films in years!
Saw is a good movie. It's suspenseful, gory, and keeps your attention. At the end you'll be wondering what happened, and will have to rewind. The only thing is that it doesnt fully live up to its hype.
Two words come to mind after watching this movie: HOLY CRAP!!! I love scary movie and psychotic thrillers; however, most of them don't even scare me at all anymore. Saw is so creepy and realistic that it had me wondering how long before a copy cat killer emerges. The premise of the movie is two guys are chained to pipes in a bathroom, and they are trying to reconstruct the steps to how they got there. In the midst of this reconstruction, they discuss the killer who sets up scenarios like the one they are in where the victims kill themselves. Anyway, enough of the plot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who truly loves a good psycho thriller; however, put the kids away. There is a goofy clown in this movie too....Oh no no IT. I would give this movie about 4.5 out of 5 stars, and it is well worth the rental fee.
Where this movie lacks in acting, it's totally made up with the plot and action.  The ideas that were put into this movie can only be thought up by a mad man, yet I believe he deserves an award.  This is not a 'jump out of your seat' scary movie, but more of a 'put the popcorn down because of an upset stomach' movie.  Yank this off the shelf a.s.a.p.
Word of warning to start things off:  NOT FOR KIDS!!!  Not only is the movie rated "R," it is quite grizzly.  While not unusually "graphic," it is unusually disturbing.  The creators have gone out of their way to concoct disquieting deaths and some pretty disquieting ideas.  It's the kind of movie where at the end you have to kinda wonder what kind of sick mind came up with this stuff.<br /><br />If you liked SE7EN, you might like this too.  That's the movie it's most often compared with, but that's not quite fair.  It's seedy, like much of SE7EN, but it doesn't have a Hollywood gloss on it. For all it's deranged ideas, SE7EN had a sheen of respectability brought to it by the presence of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow...all comfortable, well-known, attractive actors.  Not much of that in SAW!<br /><br />It deals with a serial-killer who isn't really.  The crazy person in this film concocts extremely elaborate ways to get his hostages to kill themselves.  One victim, for example, is told she can save herself by unlocking the huge device on her head, which, when a timer goes off, will essentially rip her head in half.  To unlock the device, she must retrieve the key from her cellmate.  Or rather, her cellmate's stomach.<br /><br />The killer watches all the shenanigans from lots of hidden cameras and such, and communicates in taped recordings that distort his voice.  We've seen all that sort of stuff before.  The cop who is chasing the bad guy (Danny Glover) is obsessed with his work, to the point where his sanity loosens and he loses his job.  Hardly original either.<br /><br />What DOES work in the film is the central scene (which feels almost like a play) where two men wake up in a most horrifically filthy abandoned public restroom somewhere.  They are chained around the ankle to thick pipes and cannot reach each other.  In the middle of the room lies a previous victim, a man who has apparently shot  himself in the head and left quite a mess on the floor.  Each man discovers a taped recording with instructions, telling them how to survive.  The main character, played by Cary Elwes (oh, how far the star of PRINCESS BRIDE has fallen), is a doctor who has been told that his wife and daughter are being held hostage, and that they can only have there freedom if Elwes kills his cellmate.  Oh, and each man has a hacksaw...not strong enough to cut the chains, but perfect for sawing off a foot to get free of the chains.  Nice, huh?<br /><br />Well, I have to admit that as the men acted out their little scenario throughout the film (the rest of the backstory is told in flashbacks) I was intrigued.  It carried a lurid fascination.  And the resolution of the film, while a bit pat, was surprising and twisty.  We think we know who the villain is...but do we?<br /><br />So, the pluses are there:  it's a compelling story (although we feel a little unclean watching it), has some surprises and has an over-the-top art direction and cinematography that is admirable in its fearlessness.<br /><br />On the down side: the acting is pretty uneven.  Glover really has nothing to work with and poor Elwes...in the past, he has done an American accent quite convincingly, but in this movie, it gets away from him time and again...lapsing into British pronunciations just enough to be quite distracting.  The young man who is the doctor's cellmate is played by screenwriter Whannel, and he comes across as a guy who's maybe done a little acting in college for fun...he's got energy, but no subtlety.  Monica Potter plays Elwes wife, and she's a cipher too.  The movie isn't terribly interested in its characters...just its situations.  And for the most part, that's good enough.  This is no SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  If the filmmakers aspired to that...they missed the boat.  If they aspired to achieve everything that the execrable FEAR DOT COM missed, then I think they did okay.  The movie shows some originality, but it feels a bit rushed.  No doubt the filmmakers were given a pretty tight budget and schdule.  Parts of it feel scotch-taped together...tug too hard and it'll all fall apart.  You don't want to think about this one too hard.<br /><br />Who to recommend it to:  filmgoers who don't mind being a little uncomfortable in exchange for some serial-killer / sicko thrills.  If you like stuff like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SE7EN and that ilk, you'll probably be okay with this film.  If you're squeamish, like your murders tidy, then stay away.  And again, if you're a parent, please keep your young kids away.  When I saw the film, there were about 10 little children in the audience, and I felt bad for them.  They'll remember (and dream about) the disturbing images...but won't actually understand what happened.
For my part, it was quite an impulsive move to view "Saw".  I had no real pre-conceived ideas beyond having heard that it was similar to "Seven".<br /><br />Although I can only give the film 4 stars, I can recommend it to all viewers of crime thrillers.  The reason for not offering a further star is that, upon reflection, the plot is perhaps too far fetched.  That point aside, the film was truly chilling.<br /><br />In brief, two men are chained together in a filthy basement toilet area.  They each have a saw although the saw is only sufficient to sever a limb and not adequate for braking their chains.  If they cannot escape within about 8 hours they will be killed.<br /><br />Through a series of flashbacks, the viewer is able to piece together a series of horrible murders that are all connected.  The connection is both the horror of the crime and the fact that the victims have a link with a local hospital.  Yet, it is only at the film's end that we come to learn who is the mastermind of the murders.  It is at this point, however, that the plot becomes somewhat implausible.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings about the plot, "Saw" is excellent drama that will keep all viewers on the edge of their seats.
I wouldn't exactly call this "horror" as much as a crime film, since there's no supernatural element in at all.  Whatever Wan was originally going for with this strange little piece, it really is a double edged sword: while lacking the power of "Seven" or "Silence of the Lambs", it has a more interesting psychopath at the base of the events than any of them.  Although we never find out who the "Jigsaw Killer" really is or about his life (other than that he is dying), his "morals" are very existential and go above and beyond the dimestore psychology of such people we are offered in most movies: "something in happened in his/her childhood, he/she is repeating the pattern, etc".  Nothing like that.<br /><br />I was misled about this film: it does NOT take place in one room.  Most of the important parts which compose the real plot<br />take place outside of the dirty utility room the men wake up in.  This is no cinematic experiment. Leigh Whannel, who wrote the film, plays Adam, one of the two who gets thrown in the proverbial pan along with Cary Elwes, who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon.  One would think that if Whannel cared enough to write this very complex story, he would have done a much better of job of acting in it. At times the acting and one liners were so bad that you would think these guys were trying out for a part in a high school play.<br /><br />The real substance of the film lies elsewhere, though. The Jigsaw Killer is a particularly volatile and concealed psychopath with a point to prove more legitimate than most of his serial killer peers: he thinks people should appreciate life while they have it.  From this he reasons that putting them in the most horrendous situations (like locking a drug addicts' head into a time-bomb-vice and leaving her to find the key might make her appreciate her face more) might shock them out of their complacency.  I don't if this is what Wan was trying to do, but I found most of the "protagonists" so boring and annoying that you're just itching to know more about the killer--the only character who isn't one dimensional.<br /><br />Some of the symbolism is unforgettable: the really deranged puppet the killer has popping up at crucial moments, and the Samurai-esque costume he wears when on the attack.  The scene in which Danny Glover (who does little but sweat, obsess and get his throat cut) and his partner happen upon Jigsaw "in the act" and the aftermath is so sadistic and gruesome that some people in the theatre screamed.<br /><br />The ending, though, is the big shocker.  This isn't a masterpiece, but it approaches one.  Worth buying when it comes to DVD.
Overall Saw was a decent movie I just wish that the lead role would have been given to someone else, Carl just couldn't get that emotion across for some reason and it took something away from the movie.<br /><br />The story and irony of of this film were great, it also had some pretty good gore along with some genuinly scary scenes,but,<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD-KEEP CARL EWLES OUT OF HORROR/THRILLER FILMS!!!!!!
"Saw", the new psychological horror/thriller directed by James Wan, is a frightening movie. Although I would not rate it as the scariest movie of this year, it has its moments by making you jump off your seat, and delivering a lot of gore scenes.<br /><br />The movie starts off well with two men, who are stranded in a room with a dead body lying in the middle and chains tied to their legs. They don't know where they are or why they are there, but find a tape in their pockets. After playing it, they realize that they are being held captive by a crazy psychopath. Will they be able to escape in time without following the mad man's orders? Will an ex-cop who is obsessed as to finding the killer be able to track him in time?<br /><br />Overall, the movie is a little above average. While I do admit that the plotline is somewhat different, and there are a lot of unexpected twists and turns (especially in the end), they could have redone a few scenes. For example, after watching the movie, I realized that the character of Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) was really unnecessary for the movie, as his character doesn't do anything to alter the plot of the storyline at all. As for the acting, I think everyone acted fairly well except Cary Elwes (who acted as Dr. Lawrence Gorden) who could have acted better.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked movies such as `Identity' and `Phonebooth', then you might enjoy this movie.
I'm probably going to get my share of flack from others on this site after they read this review, but I'm going to voice my opinion anyway.  I'm being completely honest in everything I say here.  I just viewed this earlier today at my local theater and it has to be the biggest letdown for me out of all the movies that I have seen this year.  To me, Saw has a weak and uninteresting plotline with a bunch of horrific actors weaved into it.  Cary Elwes was completely unconvincing in this picture (I've never seen him in others, so I'm only going by his performance here) When the film first started, I wasn't getting into it then, but I decided to wait it out, hoping that things would pick up by mid picture, but sadly to report, it did not.  I wasn't scared at all, I was disinterested.  I was so bored, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.  I wasn't the only one.  I was the only one left in the theater because everyone was walking out (I never walk out of films, but I REALLY wanted to).  I heard one comment as a dad and his son were exiting: "this is too long." I also agree, what was shown here could have been accomplished in less than an hour and forty minutes.  The concept of using Jigsaw to freak people out may work with young kids, but it didn't work with me.  I was completely unaffected by this picture, psychological thriller/horror or whatever genre would be the appropriate placing for this.  I did get the message out of this as some people are stating in their reviews, but did they really have to put it in such an overrated and dreadful film? I think this movie gives psychological thrillers a bad name.  I've seen some exceptionally wonderful films in that genre, including One Hour Photo.  I wouldn't recommend this picture to anyone, rental or otherwise.  I firmly believe it's a big waste of money and time.  It sure was for me, at least.  I had to chuckle to myself when "game over" was said-I was counting my lucky stars that I didn't have to sit through that "game" any longer. I've never seen any of the movies that this has been compared to (mostly speaking of Seven here) but I'm sure those movies are much better in storyline and acting than this (I honestly doubt it could be worse)
I believe this film had promise--at least in the beginning however it quickly descends into a horrific mess with tons of plot holes and a premise that is just shy of absurd.  Danny Glover is totally wasted and it's hard to believe he even did this movie.  Avoid.
I originally intended to watch Saw in the theatres to get the full effect that I thought I could get from such a movie. Thank god I didn't waste my money. Now usually I'm a pretty easy going critic of scary movies. But this one I just couldn't appreciate no matter how hard I tried. As far as the plot line goes, it wasn't too bad. The fact that its been done a million times, the bad guy trying to teach "innocent" people lessons, is getting a little played out. The aspect of the movie which I could not get over was the HORRIBLE acting. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell over acted so much that it seemed funny. Even Danny Glover, who played a disjointed cop, was unconvincing. It got to the point that I was wishing someone would stop playing games with him and just put ME out of my misery by killing both of them. Now not to take anything away from the plot because I actually thought it was still creative even after being done a million times before. I also liked James Wan use of lighting and how he kept things a little abstract and dark so that we couldn't get the whole picture until the end. Now Saw 2 is in pre-production and I can only hope the casting director will step up and get some really good actors so we can all enjoy the "Jigsaw Killer's" next little game!
The movie overall is fabulous due to the plot and how the all the main characters are inter connected and how lawrence and adam continue decieving one another as the movie progresses. Although, you dont see any one in the act of getting stabbed when ever friday the 13th has that, but in this movie blood just squirts up and its the same ways when lawrence saws off his leg. So if you only like horror for blood and gore id reccomend the uncut version or another movie, but if you're like me then you can like a movie simply for its plot and characters
This was probably the best movie I saw last year. Besides the blood-rivers there's a message on the movie: enjoy life what it last.<br /><br />The movie have crude scenes but I think the main point should not be that; there are reasons about life and a puzzle to be solve. The characters puzzle itself is more interesting than see those explicit acts of violence.<br /><br />Why we destroy ourselves? What things we are willing to do when we see our life in risk? Why we put our life in risk at the first?  There's a lot of thoughts to be learned most of them related to have a reason to take care of ourselves and our live.<br /><br />Buy this movie if you either like crude/violent/blood scenes, or if you want to see a diferent way to approach the search of a reason to be alive.
I can't believe they have this movie now on dvd and the best part is its even UNRATED which is cool, I saw this in the theatre but with an R arting, so this is just really totally awesome. I just don't have a lot to say about this movie because I want you to watch it instead, this movie is not for the weak stomach and squemish viewers, one of the best horror/gore movie of the year that I have ever seen, low budget films are often the ones that are awesome like this movie, or "High Tension" "Wrong Turn" etc..  For those who rated this movie a 1 star, don't believe them, I wonder why they watch this movie if they are into a Love Story genre movies, duh!  Go for it, buy this dvd.
A very effective horror movie.  It proves that you don't need a huge budget to create a scary movie.  There are certainly flaws, but they are easily overshadowed by what is good.  The new uncut version is very similar to the original, but does contain more gore, and some new music.  Lots of nice special features and commentaries make this a winner.
I bought this movie and i thought it was awsome.This movie is very suspensfull and had you at the edge of your seat from almost the start.The twist is awsome you would never expect it.They had a good choice of characters and it toke them only 18 days to shoot it.
I went to see this movie by myself. I am a girl, who loves scarey movies, and I dont scare easily. I was sitting alone drinking a large mountain dew, yelling, OMG, NO!, OMG several times. There are also a few jumping moments in the movie.<br /><br />The last 45 min I had to go to the bathroom SO bad but I couldnt leave my seat. This movie has gotten bad reviews by the 'critics' but thats typical with horror movies. It is a great story, lots of suprises, some things you just cant believe! As soon as it ended, I couldnt wait to go see it again!! I hate predictable movies, and I thought I had this one figured out three different times, and in the end none of my guesses were right. Great movie, great story, recommended it to everyone I know.
Director James Wan and writer (and star) Leigh Whannel met each other at Australia, where they developed their friendship.  They established friendship there, and made this film, which has been picked up the marverick indie company Lions Gate Films for Holloween release.<br /><br />Now, the premise is intriguing.  Two guys are chained (literally) to the walls of a filthy disused restroom, both apart from each other, and in between them lies an apparently dead body soaked in blood.  They cannot untie the chain, and the room is perfectly sealed.  It's the beginning of the game, set by the serial killer called 'Jigsaw.!<br /><br />And two guys, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Wannel himself) try to figure out how to get out of this place.  Obviouly the third person has hidden the clues there as to the escape, or the reasons for their predicament.  And they will see that if they fail to do something by the time appointed, they must stay there for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />Intersting, isn't it?  The film often gives very intense moments (which include gore and violence) but the sad thing is that the script cannot hold the initial tension for long.  If you imagine the film like 'Cube' (in which the camera does not leave the cubic areas), you are mistaken, for the camera goes out of it, to show us other characters like Danny Glover's cop who chases the murderer, or Monica Potter as poor doctor's wife.<br /><br />And that's the problem, for in spite of the occasional intense moments, the film fails to use its premise to the full.  It unwisely includes the incredible coincidences and unexplained (or inconvincing) motive of the character(s), especially that of the killer.  Frankly, I don't believe it.  Compared with this, the killer of 'Se7en' is more plausible.<br /><br />Plus the opinions will divide about the ending, which is full of impact, I admit, but after a while you might start to think, 'Can this person really do that?' or 'Is this person (I mean, the killer) capable of doing that, chaining the two perfectly heathy guys?'  Sorry, but I don't believe that either.<br /><br />Anyway, as a thriller, it is done with a certain flair for visuals, and the filmmakers' guts to tuckle the morbid material should not be dismissed.  But if you ask me whether or not 'Saw' deserves the extensive national release it will receive, I say, No.  It is good, just good.

Ok, this movie is so stupid. It is not a scary movie AT ALL. It was boring, predictable, and only had a few moments that were really suspenseful. I can't believe that there's been three sequels from this movie. I mean, come on!!
I gotta say, when I went to see this movie, I was expecting something different. From the ads, I figured it was going to be a hardcore psychological thriller with a hearty dose of the old ultraviolence to keep things moving along.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Saw is actually not a thinly veiled takeoff of "Se7en" at all! Rather, it's a tongue-in-cheek parody of the genre. Or at least, I think it was. I wasn't too certain after a while--that's how closely they walk the line with this movie.<br /><br />After the initial genre confusion wore off, I found it a very enjoyable film indeed. Ask the guy two seats ahead of us, who kept turning around to tell me off for laughing.<br /><br />Don't be turned away by the promises of sadism and gore--they're in this film, in spades, but they aren't the focus of the movie itself. Yes, it's bloody and overblown. But it's more than that--it's a total laff riot. From the Insane Black Cop to the Adorable Little Girl In Peril, this movie has it all. It's a veritable cornucopia of cheesy cliche and saw-it-coming-a-mile-away plot twists.<br /><br />Imagine "Se7en" put to slamming metal music, filmed in some guy's semi-finished basement with a dirty 80 watt bulb to light the room, and you have Saw.<br /><br />Cary Elwes plays an extremely convincing role as a self-mutilating albino grub-man with tiny pretty eyes. The Adorable Little Girl In Peril debuts with authenticity and passion, but you'll find the scenes stolen again and again by that lovable scamp, Mr. Dead Guy On The Bathroom Floor.<br /><br />I think the author of the original script is in this movie as well, but I didn't see much of him because I spent a good 2/3 of the movie balled up on the sticky theatre floor, giggling helplessly while an usher nudged me angrily with the tip of his shoe.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />Come for the chilling look into the psyche of a serial killer. Stay for the wacky dismemberment sequence.<br /><br />Saw: you'll never look at your poo-filled toilet the same way again!
If you haven't seen "Saw" (or is that sawn "See"?), don't read this. What a shame, because the ending deserves a better movie. I can suspend disbelief ("X-Files" comes to mind), but this film is insulting in its conceits. The convenient coincidences and the maddening stupidities piling up at the end reminded me why I bailed out of the Fox TV show "24" early in its first season. How does Jigsaw lay motionless for hours? Why does Dr. Gordon saw off his foot when the saw was long enough to reach the cell phone? He's a doctor. He couldn't tie a better tourniquet to keep from bleeding to death? How does Jigsaw know so much about so many people? How did Jigsaw lower Adam into the tub, then have time to position himself in the middle of the room before the water roused Adam? Dr. Gordon was awake when Adam regained consciousness, so why wasn't he aware of the presence of Jigsaw? If there was a lapse of time between putting Adam in the tub, Jigsaw postioning himself in the center of the room and Dr. Gordon waking up, then how did Adam not drown in the tub to begin with? If you've been given a "slow-acting" poison that you know will take hours to kill you, why not go to the hospital? A poison expert could narrow down the possibilities (how many such poisons actually exist?) and administer the antidote. Your 8(?) year-old daughter tells you there's a man in her bedroom and you don't search the room just to prove there isn't? Your wife disarms the "killer" then doesn't shoot him, especially when he's seated two-feet away from your daughter who is still tied-up? The daughter cries out, of course mom is distracted and of course the "killer" disarms her. How does the "killer" escape, travel to the remote location, negotiate the catacombs and get to the room where Adam and Dr. Gordon are located as if he's been there many times before? How did Jigsaw get Dr. Gordon's penlight? Once it was determined that Dr. Gordon had an alibi, why wouldn't the police start checking into his patients or hospital employees, since Jigsaw was clearly someone who had access to Dr. Gordon? This is only scratching the surface. Watch the "Making of.." featurette on the DVD (which was also pretty weak) and you'll see that this was a great idea in search of a story. And these guys are getting the chance to make "Saw 2?" Oy vey!
I don't expect much out of horror films these days, but as a gigantic fan of the genre, I subject myself to most decently buzzed-about films that are classified as horror. First off, very few films catagorized as horror films these days are. "Scream" is not a horror film; it is a mid-nineties FOX show with suspense and a killer. "Saw" is also not a horror film, in fact, it should not have been a film at all. Cary Elwes deserves some sort of award for the worst over-acting ever committed to film (put it right up there with his portrayal of Ted Bundy in "The Riverman" and we may have the worst actor of today on our hands), the script reads like it was written by a middle-school kid daydreaming out the window about one day killing the lunch recess bully, and the visuals are god-awful( the car scene narrowly beating out the cut-to-flashback format of the first two killings. Ever since that other tremendous film "Sixth Sense", we seem to always have to have the surprise ending in every horror film, as if it is a prerequiset for the film to be made. Very rarely is this ending a surprise; here it is no different. The difference is, this ending makes absolutely no sense. There was no preperation, no thorough introduction of the character and then no identification as to real motive. This is a film made by amateurs, and it shows. Whoever green lit this peace of trash, should not be allowed that respondsibility again. This film attempts to be clever, to make you think. What it achieves, though, is completely opposite. It is films/"art" like this that help to create a less intelligent society.
I got the 2-disc DVD within a few days.  It was packaged well and I had no problems whatsoever with anything.  Thank you!
I bought this movie not thinking it would be very good, but I think this was the first movie I have ever watched a second time right after watching it for the first time, I was loving it the whole way through ,and just when you think it can't get any better , THE ENDING comes out of nowhere, Never SAW that coming ,some people can usually predict the ending on some movies ,but I don't think anyone could have possibly seen this coming. This is one of the BEST movies i've ever seen.
Starring a capable star cast in Cary Elwes (Princess Bride, Glory), Danny Glover (Lethal Weapons) and Leigh Whannell (Matrix Reloaded). If you have not heard about how SAW has change how future murder movies will be made in Hollywood, then you have not seen this movie. This is not your typical senseless dumb killings that litter so many movies in yore past. It's killing that makes you think and go 'oooohhhh i see'. Like how far would you go when survival is at stake ...something you normally do regularly is raised to another level involving your very dear life....would you...could you?  The protagonist stunning protrayal of emotion is shown here to the max which is as real as it gets my friends. The big question i have here to all the fans who seen SAW is this:<br /><br />Would you "SaW" off your own foot to save those you loved, if not you?<br /><br />Think about it!<br /><br />It might happen to you one day. This movie will guide you thru the intense horror as you about to witness what fear is really like when it happens to you. Smartly done and highly recommended. I saw SAW II and the original SAW is the one that started it all....a bonified classic!
Saw, starring Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, and Cary Elwes is an intense roller coaster with twists and turns and hairpin curves. Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) wake up, each chained by the leg to a pipe in a filthy old utility room, prisoners of a criminal called Jigsaw who plays with the minds of his victims by devising tortuous games forcing them to choose between the lesser of two evils in order to live.<br /><br />The movie transcends beyond a classic horror/slasher flick to become a psychological suspense thriller. Just when you think you've got it figured out, the movie throws another curve ball at you and turns all your suppositions upside down. It's a terrific movie that will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat!
SAW really brings back the true HORROR in horror movies. This is not some *teen comedic-slasher* movie that seems to jhust mock horror. This is a real good bloody, gruesome story that could frighten anyone. With that being said, yes, it does have a big CSI influence on it, but still, it is a horror film. Anyways i really like this movie..one of my favorites
"SAW", Is one of the smartest, most<br /> intellegant and well thought out films<br /> of the modern day (American) horror<br /> genre, like most american horror films<br /> at this point in time it loads up on<br /> the blood & guts BUT, what alot of<br /> people dont pay any attiontion to is<br /> that their is a much more deeper<br /> meaning than the basic blah, blah,<br /> villian cuts a little hear, maybe a<br /> little their yada,yada so on and so<br /> forth. "SAW" takes you on a wild and<br /> brutally insane roller coaster extra-<br /> vaganza that will keep you wondering<br /> from beginning to end ... not to<br /> mention a .... KILLER ending...<br /><br />Grade: Somewhere between a B+ and an A-
This movie is a pathetic attempt to create a so called "Psychological Thriller" without giving the motivations and in depth character analysis of the people involved. All you have left is two guys chained up in a grimy public restroom talking ad infinitium and ad nauseaum about every little detail they can think of. This movie is suppoed to have a "Twist In The Tale 'accordingthe the blurb on the DVD cover but I saw (no pun intended) it coming a mile off.I give this movie 5 stars because they must have paid Danny Glover a lot of money to once again play "Action Man Super Cop"
This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Yeah the acting wasn't very good.  Other than that it was great.  The ending was definitley surprising and I loved it.  I can't wait until the sequel.  The first was great and from what I've seen of the second it will be no less.  October 28 can't come sooner.  If you haven't seen this then go rent it or buy this new edition.
if gorey is what your looking for then this is it.<br /><br />if plot is what your looking for then it seems like this movie is a lot like the plot of another by the name of "SEVEN"<br /><br />its not like a clone of SEVEN but in ways its the same.<br /><br />i also hated the ending if you have one bullet you shoot the pad lock... duh
I love SAW! I mean, it had a micro-budget and just over two weeks shooting time! How many recent "horror" movies have come and gone, costing zillions of dollars and taking months to complete, only to stink up our theaters? I like it when unknown directors come along and give us movies that ignore the hollywood formula of $$$ + HYPE - ORIGINALITY = $$$$$$ (like: Night Of The Living Dead, Dementia 13, Carnival Of Souls, Spider Baby, The -original- Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Donnie Darko, May, etc.). SAW actually held my interest throughout, and genuinely shocked me at the end. Remember how the ending in SE7EN made you feel? I sure do, and SAW made me feel that same wonderful mix of dread and amazement! Any flaws can be easily excused considering the aforementioned budget and time constraints. Just watch it and enjoy it...
This is a great movie from beginning to end with a sursprise ending, but don't ask me what it is go out and buy it.
This was probably one of the coolest most messed up movies I have EVER seen!<br /><br />It starts out with two guys left chained up in what looks like an old bathroom. There's a man with a gun and a tape recorder in the middle of the room, who appeared to be shot in the head.<br /><br />In order for the kidnapper to let them go, one of them has to kill the other one, and if he wants to live, he has to survive from trying to be killed.<br /><br />I don't want to give the rest away because you HAVE to see this movie.<br /><br />It's DEFINITELY not one for the weak of heart, and it is REALLY disturbing (one of the most I've ever seen and I've live for horror!)<br /><br />If you like sick gory movies, this is a winner!
I thought this movie was genius! It starts off with two men waking up in a filthy bathroom. As the movie goes by they try to figure out why someone would do this to them and the doctor tells stories and he has flashbacks of a couple of suspicous things happening to him over the past couple of days and he talks about the "jigsaw" killer who picks people who have made bad choices in life and are not grateful about the things that they are givin in life and he puts them in a situation were they have to basically mutilate themselves or someone else in order to live. Then it ends up that the two men are connected in some way and whoever the killer is he is watching them. This movie is very well packaged it has gore suspense and you will never ever ever figure out who the killer is. This movie is brilliant and I can't wait until the second one comes out. This is definitely a need to own movie for all of you Horror fans like me!
ok, honestly, watching the previews for this movie didnt really imply that it was oscar worthy. it looked like a bunch of uneccessary gore, and make no mistake, it is violent. however, its actually a very good movie. the acting isnt A+ at moments, but the story is actually very well written. the movie obviously doesnt rely on its cast (when's the last time cary elwes was the top guy, Robin Hood Men In Tights?) so it hits you with a plot that twists your mind in 8 different directions. the games the killer plays are groteque and may make the weaker audience turn away, but the lessons that Jigsaw teaches do have a purpose. the end was my favorite, if any of your friend told you they predicted the end to this movie, its a lie. it's so out of left field, yet still blows you away in that, when you think about it, its not illogical. no, the movie isnt Se7en (the movie that set the standerd for this genre) but its still worth the price of admission. fans of the creepy crime dramas are sure to enjoy sAw. hopefully the sequal is just as good, or better.
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's intrigating and smart and it has such a surprising end. If you like suspense you are going to love it. Just make sure you understood the end, many people I have talk to about this movie have not understood and thats probably why many people didn't like it.
There haven't been a lot of good, scary movies recently except I thought this one was very scary and intriguing.  I liked the plotline even though the actors could use a few more classes.  The concept of this film was incredible - it's a different kind of murder movie - it's psychologically and physiologically thrilling - I would recommend it!
I dont know what these other reviewers have been smoking??? This movie is so worth seeing and even owning. I admit I do own very few movies only because most I only watch once, but this one I will definatly watch over and over. The acting wasnt fantastic, but it kept you interested and was well done with the material, and the plot twists were awsome. I was on the edge of my seat through at least 90 percent of the movie. Finally the ending....WOW!!! The ending is DEFINATLY one you will NEVER guess. I was blown away!!! So out of 5 stars I give "SAW" 5 stars, it is defiantly worth it!!!!
"Saw" is a creepy low budget film with high wattage actors. It promises to deliver tense moments and it does. Several reviewers have stated that it puts up one too many red herrings and, you know, maybe that's true, but frankly I love that stuff - I eat up Agatha Christy-type story lines. And this is somewhat in that vein - just extremely gory.<br /><br />A couple of guys who don't know each other wake up in a disgusting bathroom (I think it's the one that Ewan McGregor went toilet diving in Trainspotting...)chained to the walls. The corpse of someone who blew his own brains out lies between them. They can't free themselves unless one or both of them can saw off his leg using a saw provided by their tormentor (yes, they try it on the chains first to no avail).  Provided with piecemeal clues, the men try to devise a way out of their prison, only to find that if they don't do exactly as their tormentor has stated one of the man's family will be murdered.<br /><br />The cast includes Cary Elwes (Princess Bride and Twister), Danny Glover (do you really need help here?), Monica Potter, and a few unknowns (one of whom wrote the story).<br /><br />The acting is well above par for such a film. The film is sufficiently claustrophobic when it needs to be and expands outside to give us a bit of breathing room only to reel us back in for more.<br /><br />If you have a stomach for some gore and a few really good thrills, check this film out.
TWO MEN [CARY ELWES AND LEIGH WANNELL] BOTH WAKE UP IN A MYSTERIOUS ROOM WITH A MAN WHO'S KILLED HIMSELF. AS THEY'RE TRAPPED DUE TO THE FACT THAT CHAINS ARE LOCKED ON THEIR FEET, THEY REALIZE A MYSTERIOUS KILLER IS PLAYING A VERY SICK GAME WITH THEM. THIS GORY HORROR FILM IS ENTERTAINING AS WELL AS VERY INTELLIGENT. DON'T READ THAT REVIEW WRITTEN BY THIS SITE THAT'S ON THIS PAGE AND DON'T READ THE REVIEWS POSTED BY THE REVIEWERS WHO THOUGHT THIS FILM SUCKED. THIS FILM IS VERY GOOD AND VERY SUSPENSEFUL. THINK OF IT THIS WAY: IT SURE IS A NICE BREATH OF FRESH AIR CONSIDERING THAT 70% OF THE HORROR FILMS THAT'RE BEING PUT OUT TODAY SUCK!! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD HORROR FILM TO WATCH, RENT [OR POSSIBLY EVEN BUY] THIS MOVIE THE NEXT TIME YOU HEAD TO YOUR VIDEO STORE. BECAUSE OF ITS ENDING [WHICH I WILL NOT TELL YOU, BUT YOU WOULD PROBABLY KNOW IT ANYWAY], THERE HAS TO BE A SEQUEL.
The best thing about Saw is its premise. But if you're looking for Saw to be something beyond simply a creepy idea, you'll probably be disappointed.<br /><br />The performances turned in by both lead actors are downright bad. Leigh Wannell, who co-wrote the script, should probably stick to writing as he fails to bring any real life to his character. Cary Elwes, who's been enjoyable when cast in lighter fare just can't pull off the level of emotion needed. His cries of "Allie? Allie!?" should be gut wrenching. Well, they are, but for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />The film's twist ending is...well, interesting. It could have been good had it been written better, but as it is, it adds a huge number of holes to the plot. That said, if you're the kind of person who likes to shut off their brain entirely when watching a movie, you probably won't be troubled.<br /><br />One positive about the movie is the competent direction of James Wan, who shows that he knows a thing or two about atmospherics. It's largely because of him that the film still engaged me with its creepiness, even when the wretched acting made me want to give up.<br /><br />Overall: Creepy, but crippled by bad acting and gaps in plotting.
Saw is a great movie, all the sequels can be skipped. However the video quality on the Blu-ray is pretty disappointing. Very grainy, never once really looked like a high-def video even in bright scenes. But what makes it even worse is that there are no extras whatsoever. No commentary, no deleted scenes, nothing besides some previews. Sad,sad,sad. At least it was cheap.

Heck yeah! Finally, a mainstream horror movie that's not afraid to be gritty. No campy, PG-13 family-friendly crap. No teenagers running around  having sex and then getting hacked by a lumbering serial killer. Just 2 men locked in a dirty bathroom, cryptic clues left by a deranged killer, and a puppet.<br /><br /> The beauty of this movie is in its simplicity. The entire film was shot in one building with an extremely low budget. The two main characters, a photographer named Adam and a surgeon named Lawrence, wake up one day to find themselves locked in a grimy bathroom, chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room. In between them, there is a dead body with a gun in one hand, a tape recorder in the other, and his brains blown out and pooling on the floor. From then on, the two men must work together to solve the puzzle the killer, Jigsaw, has left them, and get out of their situation alive.<br /><br />  Jigsaw is a serial killer who uses "traps" to test his victims. His basic M.O. is that he puts them in situations, often with medieval-like torture devices, that will either kill them horribly, or leave them alive with permanent psychological and/or physical damage. Most of the time, these traps relate in some way to the person's lifestyle. Jigsaw's goal is to teach people to be grateful to be alive.<br /><br /> There are many misconceptions people have about this movie. First of all, it's not THAT gory. Yes, there is blood aplenty, and the traps Jigsaw sets for his victims(including a web of barbed wire a man must plow through, and a device hooked into a woman's jaw that could potentially permanently rip her mouth open) are just sick. But most of the horror comes with the THOUGHT of how painful the traps are, and not necessarily what is shown on screen. The majority of the gorehounds I know say that this movie is pretty tame.<br />  Second of all, "Saw" is NOT torture porn. "Hostel" is torture porn. "Touristas" is torture porn. "Saw", however, is not. You know why? The fact of the matter is...THERE IS NO PORN IN THIS MOVIE. Not even a boob or a buttcrack. THERE IS NO NUDITY. And heck, there isn't really any "torture" either...not really.<br /><br />  However, I'm not gonna lie and say this movie is flawless. This has a lot to do with the director's lack of money, but that doesn't account for everything. In fact, I can see why some people really don't like this movie.<br />  There are a ton of plot holes and unanswered questions. There are quite a few hammy one-liners("This is the most fun I've had without lubricant!"), and the acting in some places is hilariously abysmal(Like when Adam pretends to die). I understand how these could get in the way of enjoying the movie, but for me, they weren't that big of a deal.<br /><br /> All in all, this is one creepy and fascinating movie. The most enjoyable aspect of it is discovering more and more facts about the two main characters as the movie progresses, and discovering the connection they have while watching them learn to cope and work with each other. While not perfect, it's certainly entertaining and worthwhile.
Given that just about every movie poster advertising Saw and Saw II involves body parts, I gave the film a pass.  Not because I was afraid it would be gross, but because I've long since lost any interest of watching horror movies with an audience; movie horror audiences tend to be loud, scream at stupid things, and otherwise just plain irritating to anyone who wants to actually, ya know...enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Someone finally lent me Saw (thanks Matt!), so my wife and I got the chance to see it. This becomes problematic when you talk about the film to other people.  "Did you see Saw?" "I saw Saw."  "You saw what?" "I said I saw Saw." "Stop repeating yourself..." You get the picture.<br /><br />Anyway, the plot begins with Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) waking up in a nasty-looking bathroom.  A dead guy is in the center, apparently having blown his brains out.  In one hand is a gun, in the other a tape recorder.  Eventually, our two protagonists discover they have a tape in their pocket, and a lot more in common than they think.<br /><br />The first half of the movie unfolds in flashbacks as Gordon explains who they're up against.  Their nemesis is the serial killer known as Jigsaw.  Only he doesn't technically kill people; Jigsaw makes his victims kill themselves or each other. Jigsaw is a genius on the level of a Batman villain, a master of puppeteering, trap making, and disguise.<br /><br />If you've seen Se7en, you've seen most of what Saw's all about: the dark blue/green lens, the ever-present filth and grime, the weary black detective (in this case, Danny Glover). The difference is that Jigsaw's violent morality plays are considerably more contrived.<br /><br />That said, this is a film that revels as much in the psychological horror of the human condition as it does in gore.  What are you willing to do to save your life?  And assuming you're a paragon of morality...what would you do to save the lives of your family? Finding out how our protagonists answer those questions is half the fun.<br /><br />The movie has its flaws.  For one, poor Elwes still sounds like a Brit pretending to be an American with an aristocratic accent.  Glover doesn't seem to have much to do but growl.  And Jigsaw is a diabolical genius with a lot of time on his hands.<br /><br />By far Saw's biggest problem is that it's just plain cheap. The supposed car chase looks like two guys pretending to drive cardboard vehicles while making "vroom vroom!" noises.  Blood looks like ketchup.  Weird cut scenes skitter away from anything of substance, cleverly disguising the poor special effects with blinding headaches.  That's what you get for a $1.2 billion budget and an 18-day film shoot.<br /><br />Still, Saw managed to surprise me with its ending.  There's so much going on and so many plot twists that I wasn't expecting the sudden revelation of Jigsaw's identity.<br /><br />Is it gross?  Not really.  Other than the thought of how disgusting some things are, the "wet" factor is it relatively mild.  Is it scary?  Definitely. There's enough gruesome traps and awful choices that one of them is bound to strike a nerve with every viewer, enough to make your skin crawl.  In that respect, Saw is a resounding success.<br /><br />See Saw.  There, I said it.
The unrated version isn't that much different. But it adds to the movie. I think they could have put in alot more gore. But what they added was cool. I really like the movie SAW. So, I wasen't dissapointed. I liked the theater version. So, seeing a version with a little extra was a bonus.
Saw is a horror movie released last year that certainly delivers. Its cast is basically made up of people that I never heard of besides Danny Glover. It certainly has its faults as does every movie but it is a genius horror movie compared to the rest of them.<br />First off, most of what happens in the movie is effective. It opens with two men in a room, chained to posts. They don't know each other. Information is left telling them that one of them needs to kill the other in a certain amount of time or his family will be killed. Soon, they realize that they've been abducted by the Jigsaw Killer, a highly insane madman. Meanwhile, detectives are investigating his murders and are trying to find the newest victims before it's too late for them.<br />The movie packs chills a plenty and some scenes will make you grossed out. For a horror movie, it's in the top 5 I've ever seen; for a regular movie, it still is a very good movie worth the watch.<br />The ending has a huge twist that was geniously conceived and worth the watch alone. Everything clicks right though in this movie that is simply a must see. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel but I doubt that it will be able to surpass this movie.<br />So this Halloween, rent Saw, check it out and then watch the sequel which I'm sure will be great.<br />The ending in my opinion is one of the best ever in horror movies and really came out of nowhere and it will make you view the movie differently every time you will see it.<br />Now for the real review...This movie is in my opinion better than all of the Hannibal movies. Why? Because this movie is very entertaining. It is obvious that it was a low budget movie but this plot is genius. The whole time, you're on the edge of your seat. You're like on a roller coaster ride..and when you think that it will slow down, it just keeps on going until at the end when the roller coaster just blows up. The ending is to me the best I've ever seen. Look how genius it is. Don't tell me any of you thought of it! Sure the Silence of the Lambs has better acting but really..this movie is splendid and really entertaining. I loved it and now own it because it's a one of kind movie regarded by most as your average horror flick but it's not..like Identity, this movie becomes more than a horror movie..it becomes an excellent movie..a smart thriller with great thrills and twists that is worthy to add to your collection. So please don't regard this as your typical so so horror movie that you might want to rent for Halloween. Because what you will find here if you look a little closer is a geniously thought out movie that is trully one of a kind.
I enjoyed the movie and if you did too, I would recommend reading books by Richard Laymon. In specific a book called In the Dark, but really any of his other books have the same kind of perverse twistedness of Saw.
Good movie doesnt really get boring which is a good thing. But in a sense it is a bite off of "SEVEN" and some other movie but i cant remember. I wont go into detail but, its an ok movie. Im a big fan of 70's and 80's horror some 60's a majority of my collection horror atleast is like I said 70' and 80's so alot of this new stuff does not appeal to me much, at all. I did buy it from best buy cause it was only $14.99 whcih is not bad and I will watch it again from time to time on rare occasion, i more or less really brought just because I like to collect DVD's and it is good enough to buy. If you want a movie with a similar plaot and IMO just way better ,Buy the movie "SEVEN" which is one of the newer late 90 movies that i actually think is an excellentaction/thriller/horror.
I wanted to start this review by sharing a few choice words toward the handful of individuals who said this was a bad movie, but better I think that I stay on the point of reviewing this movie. The mistake I think many had going into this movie with, is the belief that it was a horror movie in the genre of movies like HALLOWEEN, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, AND FRIDAY THE 13th, (which are played out and tired at this point)and for those of you that enjoy this particular type of horror, please dont waste your time on this movie. This movie is what I like to consider SMART HORROR, found in movies like SEVEN, or any one of the HANNIBAL, movies (where the flavor of the movie is built on suspense and the frightening thought that THERE REALLY ARE WACKED OUT SOCIAPATHS LIVING AMONGST US THAT REALLY DO COMMIT CRIMES LIKE THIS and that we, one day could become a victim to such an individual). For I am sorry to say, it sems unlikely that any of us will ever have to face the unkillable monsters found in Halloween, Nightmare, or Friday, for to me, as a child such movies were quite scary, but now as an adult, the fear factor of such characters are laughable at best.  Heck I'll be honest even when I went to the website www.sawmovie.com I was thoughoughly creeped out. I dont like to be a SPOILER as some are in their movie reviews so ill just ask a few questions (from the movie) to help you decide if youd like to see it: Would you be willing to kill another person to save yourself? Would you be willing to suffer amputation in order to save yourself and family? How would you handle being left alone to die? If your interest has been stirred by these questions then please check this movie out, I consider myself I true horror fan and must say this movie was well worth it<br /><br />P.S. to the greedy Hollywood moguls that are presently working on SAW 2 I beg of you dont and I repeat dont turn this into another worthless sequel (or number of sequels) that destroys an excellent concept like the first three movies I mentioned in this review
Saw functions on two levels, as a serial killer thriller and a psychological horror film. It achieves success in both areas, and is actually a good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe. While hardly a great movie, it is good for it's genre, and should appeal to it's fans.<br /><br />The movie opens with two characters, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and nondescript young Joe-everyman Adam (Leigh Whannell), waking up in some dingy forgotten bathroom, chained to the walls with a dead body lying between them. We soon learn, well ahead of the main protagonists, that they are the victims of a serial killer known as "Jigsaw", known for his unusual MO of having his victims kill themselves somehow. To elaborate on that would be giving too much away. Both men discover that they are in danger, and they must work together to find their way out, otherwise Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter will die, and they will rot in their "prison". Added to the mix is the disgruntled cop (Danny Glover) who has personal reasons for finding the serial killer, who basically adds filler to the story that would otherwise be too short for a feature length movie. While Saw borrows from more prominent serial killer movies, especially Seven, it does have some unique twists and clever fright scenes. Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere. The dank bathroom and the spooky interior settings make this movie very unsettling, while the more visceral horror works on a more psychological level.<br /><br />Saw works on the whole, but it is not without flaws. For starters, a good plot doesn't necessarily mean a good script. The dialogue, written by star Leigh Whannell, it totally banal and stilted, and it makes the screenplay seem very much like the work of an amateur. Next, the acting is less than first rate. Whannell is not bad, but Elwes is definitely out of his element in this movie. While he is not known as great actor, he has done much better than this before. However, my biggest problem is with the Danny Glover character, the clich&eacute;d "bitter cop out for revenge" subplot that has been done to death, and it adds nothing of value to this movie.<br /><br />Despite it's shortcomings, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience. The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.
this is a great horror flick despite what people's expectations are. i guess i am getting tired of all these cgi monsters and special effects because when i seen this movie, it brought a sense of stomache turning that i haven't had in a horror movie in a while.<br /><br />first off, it isn't lacking in the se7en-style gore which was a plus in my books. of course there are the twists in this flick, but that isn't what caught my attention. it was the lack of computer tricks. some of the plot is somewhat unrealistic or unclear, but who cares. i typically don't go see horror movies to make sure that the entire movie runs flawlessly. i go to see these movies for their shock value and that is why i give this movie five stars.
This film is certainly worth watching once, but it can be such a stomach churner that only the gnarliest gore hound might want to put this one in the must buy column.  A tightly spun story unfolds nicely through flashbacks and present tense with some solid acting in particular by Cary Elwes.  The ending for some might fall a little flat seeming a little forced, but the first 1 hr and 24 minutes is really good stuff, very twisted and original.  Thumbs up I just wonder if a little more production time might have improved the rushed tagged on twist ending that falls apart a little bit with some afterthought.  Still the best "new" horror flick I have seen in awhile.
This is a really cool movie. It's not just horror or just suspense; it combines a lot of the motifs in these genres to make for an entertaining ride. Critiquing this film is a lot like grading a poor student who you really like as a person. You know they dont deserve a good mark, but he/she is so darn fun and enjoyable, that you cheat yourself a bit.<br /><br />This film has very good writing for the most part. Expect some funny dialogue and interesting special effects, along with decent acting and slightly better direction. Also expect to roll your eyes a few times in the film. But, the ending will make up for it.<br /><br />I was really into the film until it came to that pivotal/climactic scene where the victim final gets away from her kidnapper, who has been torturing her, and has the gun in her hand, all she has to do is shoot, but what does she do?...she calls her husband. Yeah, doh! Giving the creep just enough time to attack her again. I mean doesn't this happen in every mediocre suspense film? Honestly now.<br /><br />However, the ending of the film is so unexpected and fitting that it actually makes up for the mentioned flaw.<br /><br />Overall, it's worth watching at least once. You'll never guess who the killer really is, and at the end you'll say "whoa!"
What a great choice for a rental for this weekend!<br /><br />When Saw was released, it got mixed reviews. My newspaper gave it the "bomb" rating.<br /><br /> The movie's about this killer kidnapping people and making them play 99% impossible puzzles. When a guy named Adam and a doctor get kidnapped, they need to solve the mystery.<br /><br /> This movie is gory, disturbing, and just plain fun. Lots of plot twists that will make you keep guessing! Bring on Saw 2!
SAW is just brilliant.... i was in awe the whole time... i like the fact that the killer is really not a killer he is just a kidnapper that gets people because they dont appreciate life... its true people dont cherish life like they suppose too (but that is another story).<br /><br />i have never seen a movie that made me think about it for days... i was thinkin that the same thing could happen to me... and that is the scariest part of them all...<br /><br /> not to ruin the movie but the people in the movie basically are the killers cause the jigsaw puzzler is  a puzzle wizard and gives the people time to solve it or its too late...<br /><br />overall this is a movie i will cherish for the rest of my life.... i have never seen a movie like this and iw will reccomend this movie to anyone.....if they are into movies like this......<br /><br />5++++++++++++: pure brilliance!!!!
I work at blockbuster so I just got the movie in today,  Good look to the dvd I only wish their was more in it, all their is, is a few trailers and a sneak peak of the making of saw, also a music video.  I was kinda hoping that we'd be able to see the uncut version of the movie.  I don't know tho the movie is great tho perfect choice  great thriller for the remotely intelligent people.
Aside from all of the negative reviews, this movie is a stylish, suspense/thriller with a gory edge and a twisty turny plot which you wouldn't be able to guess, until it's revealed in the end. It's been compared to Seven, and said that the director, James Wan has seen it too many times, and is trying too hard but fails to deliver. Well, if you love horror/suspense/thrillers and are in the mood for something besides the typical emotionless masked killer stalking random people and hacking them up, then give this a try. It makes you think, and has an underlying uneasiness about it. It shows the extremes some people would go to to save their own lives, and what they would do in these horrific situations. The victims are people that the "killer", which as you will find out really doesn't do any of the killing, has chosen because of sinful things they've done, because they don't value life, so on. It makes you think, and plays around with different concepts like: What would you do to save your own life? Is the "Killer" really responsible for the murders, even though he didn't actually kill anyone? It delves into the darker and smarter side of the human psyche. Some would say to extremes, others would say it fits.
Before entering the theater to see the movie, I had mixed feelings about seeing it. At first, it seemed like some sort of Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip-off, but I was definately in error. The movie<br /><br />ended up being one of the more unique horror movies I have seen in quite a while. A doctor and a young man end up in a dark and desolate room with a dead man in there. They are both chained by the foot. After scrounging around, they find a tape and a tape player. They are informed that in order to escape, the person has to saw their foot off to break free from the chain and shoot the other person. That's just the mere begining. The killer doesn't actually directly kill people. He puts them in scenarios where they end up killing themselves (for instance, a fat man has to escape through a barbwired path to escape, but failed due to blood loss from all the lacerations from the wiring). When this comes out on dvd, I highly recommend checking this movie out. I give it four stars. The only reason why it doesn't get 5 is because it isn't quite up to the standards of the most profound classics, but it surely does come close.
this is a great horror thriller. if u liked the movie seven u will like this. it is one of the best horror flicks out there
Being a horror fan i have to say that this movie met any expectations i had and had a psycological impact that i have not experienced from a good horror film for some time.<br /><br />Overall production is slick and dark with great overtones of meance and horror, which is an achivement when one thinks that this is a very low budget flick with some  b to d grade actors (Glover and Ewles). Overall i thought the acting is good and though i agree that Ewles acting was limited i wonder if this is the fault of the director and pacing more than his overall acting ability.<br /><br />However, within the premise of the film and with so much else going on you really don't notice the acting faults unless your being quite picky.<br /><br />I find it remarkable that a film can be dripping with so much dread that you will find yourself contiually thinking " what would i do" and the charaters then do it and in many cases without success (though i don't know if i would have even attempt to climb through a container full of razor sharp wire, id think id rather stave too death but then desperate people do desperate things and one only truely knows what they would do if they were in that situation).<br /><br />The flashback of past crimes committed by the Jigsaw killer were quick but very effective and for a die hard horror fan like me , it still gave me the creeps to watch.<br /><br />Overall i though the plot was well developed  and easy to follow and the killer had way more meance to me than John Doe from Seven. And the ending for SAW is far less predictable than Seven. I guessed before the ending of Seven what would happen and i was right. There was too much build up to the ending . I knew when i saw the postal truck that it was gunna be his wife in a box and i then guessed that he would kill John Doe and i then guessed this was envy the final kill, all too predictable.<br /><br />However, SAW is one movie that i did not guess the ending correctly and was blown away (no matter how inconceivable the situation seems). Infact the ending did make sense to me because the killer is both mature and caultating and able to develop elborate plans to make his victims suffer. Meaning that he has the patience of a saint and is able to remain in control, cool calm and collective (and im sure there are killers out there like this , i mean there must be more serial killers than just the ones that get caught and are known to the public. It becomes a profession to a certain extent and with each kill they build there level of experience - so by the time yah over 40 and got away with it, you must be getting pretty good at the profession of killing and torturing). Therefore , it makes sense to me that he was able to do what he did. The ending, for me was a swift punch to the gut and even days after seeing it i think about it.<br /><br />The film is advertised as a thriller and it certainly has those elements but clearly it does fit into the world of horror more and this suits the overall film. Horror fans should get a kick out of it while the more mainstream audience should enjoy the thriller aspects but may be a bit let down by over anaylising the horror elements. The killer does come across as a bit indestructiable and the scene with the two cops in the killers lair does start to edge on stupid as they basically allow the guy walk out of the building ( i mean come on, at least shoot the guy in the leg to stop him from being so mobile) but once again try to remeber that the killer has prob spent all his life gaining control and patience to be able to pull off some really elborate kills and escapes.<br /><br />Overall, a very good horror/thriller that deserves more regonision than it gets and i look forward to seeing SAW 2 and finding out more about the man who likes to play games.<br /><br />*GAME OVER*
Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.<br />I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.<br />I just read someone reviewing "Hostel part 2" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic "Silence of the Lambs", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to).<br />Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and concidered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society???<br />If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plummer working, that would be more entertaining than this trash anyday.<br />And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there. Thank you.
(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.)<br /><br />Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out, because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.<br /><br />Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it scary, and the situations hardly made it scary, therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.<br /><br />Not even the gore could've saved the plot, and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.<br /><br />Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention poor acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance; however, this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too played-out, although not as bad as the performance by Elwes, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.<br /><br />The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it, and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted, and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.<br /><br />I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the $4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot, it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this: don't watch this movie.
In a day, where many new age teen horror movies are being born. This is fresh air in dying lungs. The Grudge, the Ring and whatever pg-13 teeny horror trash flavor of the month is out lately; it can not hold a candle to the flame that has been the "Saw" franchise. I do enjoy this one slightly more than "Saw 2" simply because I really enjoyed the plot, two guys chained to the bathroom. There is the birth of the saw franchise. Leigh Whannel (Writer, Adam) and James Wan (Writer, Director) did a wonderful job, writing a horror movie that wore their influences on their sleeve yet showed their own present imagination. This movie (for better or worse in your opinion dear reader) shows prescence from such movies as Se7en and Cube (both films I enjoy) Another aspect I enjoy about this, is the atmosphere for which this film represents. It has a dark, grim and gritty atmosphere. The great select of which the scenes were shot at alongside the haunting musical composing of Charlie C. really help add to the darkness of this film. Even though, the plot has been discussed and picked at over again, I will do the same.<br /><br />The film begins with Adam, laying in a bathtub full of water, as he begins to wake up, the water drains from the tub and he pulls himself out. Only to find he has been chained in a bathroom with another man (Dr. Lawrence) and a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in another. So begins Saw. Throughout this film, we watch as Adam and Dr. Lawrence slowly stumble upon the sad truth as to watch has been done to them (and what could happen to them if they don't use their time wisely) and what could happen to their loved ones as well. As the story moves along Dr. Lawnrence is informed that his wife and child will be slain if he does not kill his new cellmate Adam. It is truly intense watching Dr. Lawrence slow spiral down the staircase of insanity as he finds of this outcome involving the murder of his wife and child. However, they do have help (unknowing to both sides) Detective David  Tapp (Danny Glover) has become obsessed with the Jigsaw case  and as time runs short for Adam and Lawrence, he quickly trys to come upon Jigsaw's new plan. However, we also see numerous flashback scenes involving Jigsaw's other "play things" Paul, Amanda and Mark. All whos outcome I will not spoil for you. In the end, it all comes down to one final gripping scene in which this all began. A dirty bathroom.<br /><br />This movie, means alot to me and is one of my all time favorites due to its message. It's one I think anybody could relate to. We're all human, we all have selfish moments in which we take for granted those we love, be it family, friends, signifigant other or whoever else. We all have extreme limits in which our body/mind will push ourselves to do extreme, violent and mind numbing acts to save ourselves and our loved ones. Many things in which we are rarely forced to do, due to the modern day society we live in. Jigsaw is a refreshing villian in a sense because he really isn't one. While obviously he is doing disturbing evil things, its not for the sake of doing disturing evil things. In fact their is a quote he made from Saw 2.<br /><br />"John: Seems to me that the knowledge of your sons impending death is causing you to act... Why is that we're only willing to do that, when a life is at stake?<br /><br />Eric Matthews: I've always loved my son, it has never changed<br /><br />John: No... no... It's changed now. You see, the knowledge of death... changes everything. If I were to tell you the exact date and time of your death... it would shatter everything.<br /><br />This sums up the Saw franchise very well. The knowledge of changeable pending death and our ability (or those which don't have it in some cases) to dig deep and do what has to be done to live another day. This is a unique and horror franchise and this is where it all started. Enjoy.
This was an awesome movie! Bloody and creepy describes it best.<br /><br />Can you top the guy sawing off his foot?!?!?!<br /><br />That was worth the price of admission alone.
Saw gave birth to the Jigsaw Killer..which i guarantee will be famous as saw 2 Has come out (Pretty Good) and saw 3 in 1-2 years.... Saw Is a example of Tarantinos reservior dogs...Very LOW BUDGET but Excellnt Business..And Great Film..
SAW was GREAT one of my favorite movies of all time its on my top ten list its about two men who wake up in a room chained by their feet and they both have to find different clues in order to surive its a great suspense thriller that is bloody and scary this movie has all the different things you would never want to do to stay alive this movie is great and i would say more about it but i dont want to give away anything you must see this movie if you love horror films GO SEE SAW 2 OCTOBER 28  unless it gets post poned again
Loved the ending in this movie.  This movie while not flawless, had intelligence.  It is the intelligense that made this movie.  Danny Glover played perhaps his worse role ever, lol.  There was nothing about this character that I liked. And he is a good actor but he just went cold in this part.  The other acting was good to me, people keep on complaining about Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannel.  COME ON! Lol, they weren't that bad at all folks!  So what if Cary Elwes has an accent and played in the princess bride, he is an ACTOR.  Actors play many parts, this is nothing new people and you should know this!  What makes a good actor is the variety of parts he/she can play, geez.  You "horror buffs" and "movie buffs" HAVE to know this or else throw out all your pride and knowledge of movies.  And also a note, this isn't the first serious role for Elwes in a thriller, Kiss the Girls comes to mind????  Back to Saw, Good movie, great ending, intelligent, good acting (exclude Glover). I see nothing wrong with this movie. Oh yes!  Another factor of people not liking this movie was beacuse of the comparisons to Se7en it seems.  If you have a mindset that it is going to be as good as se7en then you won't like Saw.  They are different movies, DON'T compare them.  See Saw as it's own entity, and you will have a better chance of liking it.  Can't wait for Saw 2, the madness looks doubled!
Out of all the crap Horror/Thriller movies that have come out in the past year or so this is the only one I really cared for. Decent acting and a decent story as well, here lately it has been none of the above mentioned in horror movies. Definately worth checking out and it has a good ending as well.
As I'm going to have nightmares for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Definitely the most traumatizing and sickest movie I have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br />Whomever the writer is, however, is a genius because he definitely gave us a lesson in a sick and twisted way.
Where do i beging? Man this movie is the best movie ive seen so far. its scary, its thrilling, its funny, its just plain awesome. Now for does who have read that this movie is kinda like "seven" let me explain. The only reason people are compering this movie to seven is the fact that the killer in this one whants to teach a sick moral lesson. Thats the ONLY thing these movies have in comen !!!!!!
take bits n pieces of "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS" "DEEP RED" "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" & "SE7EN" grind em all up together & you have James Wan's new horror masterpiece "SAW". this twisted flick has everything a TRUE HONEST horror fan could ever ask for in a good horror movie. it has WITTT it has BLOOD & it has PURE INSANITY with a MASTERFUL ENDING! this is truely one of my new very favorite films! & to the HATER'S out there say'en that this movie is a "SE7EN" rippoff,your arguement is small!because although "SE7EN" is a great film on its own ,compared to "SAW" its a sunny walk in the park & your also just simpley underrateing this very very very intelligent masterpiece that dances circles around a movie like "SE7EN"!!!!!!!!!! anyway all you real horror fans should hurry up & go get this great new edition to the horror genre! ignore the haters & you won't regret it! i promise! ENJOY!
As a fan of the horror genre who reads a lot of industry magazines, I had read a great deal about this film long before it even hit theatres.  It eventually turned out to be a far different film that I ever thought, being far more of a psychological thriller than the crazed, serial/slasher film that it seemed to be advertised as being.<br /><br />Saw opens with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) being held captive in a dingy, grimy, foul, and mold infested bathroom.  The bathroom from hell, literally.  They are both chained by the ankle to pipes at opposite ends of the bathroom, neither one knowing how they got there or why.  Between them lies a corpse, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.  They each find a micro-cassette in their pocket as a voice ridicules them as to the reason they are held captive.  Gordon is told he must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and child will be killed.  They also find two hacksaws...too weak to cut through their chains, Gordon realizes they are for cutting through their own ankles if the want to be free.<br /><br />Through flashbacks told by Gordon, we learn of a maniac called the Jigsaw killer.  He plays a deadly game with people, putting them in horrific traps with a small chance of escape where they usually end up killing themselves.  But who is he and why is he doing this?  We learn that Gordon himself was a suspect and investigated by detectives including Tapp (Danny Glover).  Tapp eventually is dismissed from the force when he becomes obsessed with Gordon after his partner is killed by the Jigsaw Killer.<br /><br />Saw is a heavy-handed thriller/horror.  The killer has his warped, moralistic reasons for doing what he does such as trapping a prostitute in a mask that will rip her face apart unless she locates the key for the trap inside the stomach of a corpse.  The Killer seemingly goes after victims who don't have a greater appreciation for life and this does somewhat give away a major plot surprise as James Wan simply was not subtle enough to handle it more deftly.<br /><br />Elwes and Whannell give fine performances as the two men driven to the edge of sanity by their ordeal and one wishes that more time was spent building the tension between the two, rather than with so many flashback scenes.  It is in this dark, dank cell where the movie is at it's best.  Being in a place like this would make anyone cringe and run screaming.  Being held captive there would be one's own private hell.<br /><br />If SaW is guilty of one thing it's perhaps that it tries to be a little to clever for its own good.  It tries to throw a few too many curve balls at viewers to throw them off the track but in doing so, allows one to basically eliminate every character from suspicion out of general principle.  And of course there's little doubt that the film was made with the idea of a sequel already planned.<br /><br />An effective thriller, more for the mood and settings than for the actual plot, but a well done effort.
This movie was not that good.  It was ok...the premise was interesting, but the ending and the development left me wanting.  I for one didn't think Cary Elwes was that bad...I don't really look for horror movies to really have good "acting."  Danny Glover must have hit rock bottom or something by taking part in this project.<br /><br />Anyway, I would wait until this movie is at Hollywood Video or something.
Let me start out with a simple task for you. Go see this movie. It delivers in more ways than than you would imagine and will make even the most experienced horror veterans jump. The Ring didn't scare me, nor do most movies, but this really got to me. I don't know what it was about this movie that made it so good; there are so many things to say, i could be analyzing the movie all day. When i saw this movie, everyone was getting into it, there were gasps all around you, true expressions of fear. Im not talking about some idiots who cant keep their mouth shut, I'm talking about real fear coming from people who were getting very uncomfortable. This will present a challenge for anybody who thinks they no whodunit and believe me, you will find yourself so immersed in your own suspicions, the ending will hit you like a brick wall. I have seen a lot of stupid movies and i can be a pretty harsh critic, but I will recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good thrill. You will not be disappointed.
"Saw" is a badly acted movie with spotty writing and odd direction. The characters aren't believable and the twist at the end is even more unbelievable. Nothing rings true, unless you like gore for gore's sake.<br /><br />This is not a horror movie in my opinion. It's simply a horror.
I saw this movie for the first time on the SciFi channel. It is so poorly filmed that it could've been a made-for-tv movie. They must have had a very low budget to make it.
I was told by several people at work that this was the best horror movie that they had seen in a long while.  Based on their opinions, I went and bought the special edition.  After viewing 'Saw' I came to the conclusion that it was one of the silliest movies, horror or otherwise, that I had seen in quite some time.  Firstly, it's not scary in the slightest.  Gory does not equal scary in my book.  Also there were several unintentionally funny scenes in the movie.  The silly mask that 'Jigsaw' wears was just one thing that made me laugh.  If you're a connoiseur of horror movies as I am, I would recommend 'Saw' for a good laugh but nothing else.  I don't think I'll listen to the people I work with anymore.
REALLY ENJOYED THIS FILM.SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE HORROR GENRE INSTEAD OF THE SAME STORY ABOUT TEENAGERS GETTING KNOCKED OFF.NOW IF WE CAN ONLY HAVE JIGSAW DO THIS TO SOME OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS.
I should apologize for such a bad joke but it's appropriate here.  Saw stands alone as the only film this year in which, at the end, I was wishing for horrible things to happen to all the cast members and anyone connected with this monstrosity, I exempt the little girl who was too young to know any better.  Like all truly horrible experiences, this film was just intriguing enough to get me in the door, and then to keep my attention for a little while, I can forgive much in a film, especially when the filmmakers are walking such familiar ground.  Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Copycat, Kiss the Girls, The Bone Collector and on and an and on, we have seen this formula many times, most recently with "Taking Lives", all these films have much in common.  We have a serial killer who is, by necessity, crazy and brilliant, he either A. Has someone who is going to die/be killed if the hero does not solve the mystery B. He will strike again unless the hero solves the mystery.  Pick one.  With so many other films like this I don't expect big surprises, but I was wrong.  This was surprisingly, maddeningly, excruciatingly bad, really bad.  As if it weren't enough that we had a familiar story line, the producers of this bile had to handle it like a paint by numbers game.  The cop who is after the killer has all the newspaper clippings from the case taped to the walls of his crappy little studio apartment.  Why?  So the audience can read them of course, also because it is a tired clich&eacute;.  Like all bad cop movies, there is the convenient "abandon" building, the building that serves no purpose except for chasing bad guys around, and of course it is conveniently empty except for the cast.  This film takes place in one of those strange worlds where people can fire guns around and drive like maniacs and no one ever calls the police, even the police don't call the police.  At least 5 times the villain is in the crosshairs and he is let go by acts that would embarrass the three stooges, Scooby doo and the gang would have done better.  Then there is the terrible contrived acting, the players seem to be in some sort of acting workshop where they are told, off camera, "all right now cry and plead"..."good, now lets put on our angry face", everything happens because the screenplay needs it to, there is not reason to care about any of the characters and I have never, in recent memory seen a film where I was so completely angry with virtually everyone on screen, the pay off at the end was ludicrous and maddening, there was no reason for anyone to suffer through this mess.  If my leg were chained to the theater floor I might have been tempted to saw through it rather then see this crap.
This movie is quite simply a classic. Jigsaw is a one-of-a-kind villain that forces his victims to kill themselves. This is highly original. I can't wait until Saw 3 comes out. They keep coming and I keep enjoying.
This is a movie about a cereal killer with a voyeristic [...] The movie was a great idea, but the story wasn't thought out very well. There are holes in the plot you could drive a Semi-truck through. The antagonist is a very good actor, but the other actors are deffinitly lacking. Poor lighting, aparently designed to be "spooky", makes some scenes unbearable to watch. I don't know what movie some other reviewers were watching, but it seems we watched diffrent films. I think people were sucked in because the plot and or mystery was not predictable, but a mystery that doesn't make any sense is no mystery, it's a confusing story that shouldn't be told. For a really good mystery the viewer should be given the chance of figuring out the mystery as the story developes. Saw did none of that. There was no way to figure out what was going on or who was doing it while the story was unfolding. Stay away from this movie (a series now that Saw2 is out). If you want an excellent mystery/plot-twister try The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense or even the 80's flick Clue was better than this theatrical roadkill of a movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that I believe very few movies have absolutly no entertainment value. Saw did have some decent gore/bloody scenes worth checking out. If you must buy this film at least show some brains and buy it from Amazon.
Short and sweet. I knew what was going on before I got to the end but did not tell the person I was with so it does not count.<br /><br />  See if you can figure it out....so, from that point...yea....check it out but as for artistic capability, life enriching material or in thing other than blood guts and the endless insanity of Psychotic Killers either not on their medication or tired of prescribing it.......okay....give it a try.<br /><br />  I left feeling empty and dissapointed at the totality of all this suspense flop has to offer.<br /><br />  Although I will give it a thumbs up on blood and gore.
It's a really freaky movie! It's all about what all you'd do to spare your life. It's really good though. You should see it. I'm looking foward to Saw 2
to me this movie looked great in the previews and I always enjoy horror movies that critics give bad ratings to. But I agree with them this time. At first I thought I was going to sleep with the light on until I saw the ending. THE ENDING IS....... THERE ISN'T A REAL ENDING JUST A VICTIM BEING LOCKED IN A DARK ROOM. If you want to see a scary movie this isn't one to see unless you only like to watch the beginning of movies
Everyone who says this movie sucks just go jerk off to some romantic comdey or something. This is the most impressive horror movie in a long time. Ths first time director did a hell of a job. Although its not full a five star film its more like a 4.6 but i still put a five here. It has all the elements that us true horror fans are used to. So this movie is really good (considering i went to see it with little hopes it would be this good). Fans enjoy!
First of all, If I could give this movie negative stars I would. Secondly, If I had the choice of seeing this movie again, or bashing my head in with a big blunt object, I would grab the biggest rock I could find and smash away. This movie is a disgrace, and I'll tell you why I think this in a second. Before I go any further though, let me just say that this movie does have some very morbid and graphic torture scenes, and it does have a few good scenes to make you jump, but that's about it at the very least. Now, I hate this movie for so many reasons that I can't even keep count, but mostly because it wasn't what I expected it to be, or what they hyped it up to be on the previews. If you're looking for a horror or scary movie to watch this definitely isn't the movie for you, but if you need a good laugh it's perfect. Afterall, I laughed my head off because some of that stuff was so cheesy. I don't really think the budget was really the major problem because there have been some brilliant movies that had small budgets, but I do think this movie was just written terrible. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the concept of this movie, but what I can't appreciate is the shabby way they put this movie together, and then smacked us in the face with that horrible ending. I'm sorry to spoil the ending for you if you haven't been fortunate enough to see this movie, but I gotta say that having an old man that was already dying turn out to be the insane killer at the end was pure GENIUS! I wonder who's bright idea that was. I felt so cheated by the time the movie ended I just sat there looking at the credits going they can't be serious. For crying out loud, they could've just kept the hospital orderly the killer if that's the best that they could do, and even that was too far-fetched. I could bash this movie all night long, but the last thing I have to say is that I had a choice in seeing this movie, or watching "The Grudge", and I wish I would have picked the other movie.
The movie was excellant. This is the type of movie to have in your collection.
that is the central question in this creepy and excessively violent thriller that works well as long as you don't stop and think about it to long!<br /><br />  to men awake in a dirty bathroom chained to the walls,a dead body between them,with tapes telling them that one must kill the other to save his family. the man(a doctor) is given a bullet and the dead man has a gun in hand(he looks to have shot himself)! problem is neather man can reach him,but they have hacksaws,they won't cut the chain,but they will cut......well you get the idea! the rest of the movie unfolds as the men try to find out why they are there,and what's going on.<br /><br />  this grim story is one that will pull you in and has a great twist at the end,just don't think about it to much! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!!!!!!!!!!
Saw is an amazing horror flick and Jigsaw (Bell) is definitley a new horror hero. 2 men (Elwes, Whannell) are shackeled broken down bathroom. Dr. Gordon has to kill his cellmate Adam or his wife (Potter) and daughter (Vega) will die.<br /><br />Tracking down Jigsaw is a dectective name David Tapp (Glover) and his partner Steven Sing (Lueng).<br /><br />This film also stars Dina Meyer as Detective Kerry. Shawnee Smith as Amanda. And Michael Emerson as Zep Hindle. This film really has a cool idea about a killer who doesn't actually kill his victims. He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. For them to survive, they have to go through his deadly games.<br /><br />Performances are very good, some over the top, but very good. The ending really makes this film one of the best films of 2004.<br /><br />This uncut edition really has no extra scenes, just an extended scene of Amanda finding the key inside a man's body.<br /><br />Saw is a must-see horror film. And it's sequel is even more awesome.
Watching Saw, there's a feeling that this film could've been great but it never quite gets there and I can't seem to figure it out. Sure the acting is a little rough but it's a horror movie, not an Oscar contender. The film loses steam halfway through only to pick up at the end so it's not a thrill ride from beginning to end. It's got incredibly fast editing with a jerky image at times so it's obviously trying to make things more exciting than it needs too. But in the end it's a pretty satisfying film if you let it.<br /><br />The film opens with an odd idea: 2 men are chained up on opposite ends of a really dank and decrepit bathroom. In the middle is a guy with a gunshot wound in his head, a gun in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. After some searching they find out why they're there: a killer nicknamed Jigsaw put them there and wants one of them to kill the other or his wife and daughter will die. There's clues all around them to get out, including tools for one method that's quite grisly.<br /><br />You can tell there's a certain enthusiasm with this: the film doesn't have a sense of an obvious independent film as it's smartly written and has quite an ending(although it probably won't make sense). There is some gore in the film but it's not outright gory except for a few shots. In fact, except for those certain shots it's kind of tame at times. The unrated adds some extra footage but I honestly couldn't figure out where the new stuff was.<br /><br />Acting wise well..., don't forget that this is an independent film shot incredibly quickly so there's bound to be some performances that are kinda eek. The writing's pretty sharp although at times it's quite illogical. Pretty soon a character's like "wait a minute, I know this!" to actually explaining certain obvious parts. But all the clues and hidden things are clever but like I said, some are kind of like "well he figured that out pretty quickly".<br /><br />Like the other big Sundance film Blair Witch Project, it's a film that seemed refreshing and well-liked despite its flaws. I wouldn't blind buy this in case you don't like it but if you rent it and like, well why not keep it?
Fans of horror, rejoice! After the crapsome crap that's been spilling out of Hollywood like so much blood from an elevator for the last number of years, here is finally a movie with a lot of originality and some actual, honest-to-god shock moments!<br /><br />Although horror really isn't a fair genre in which to bracket 'Saw', seeing as how it's not really a scary movie, in the traditional sense of the term. No ghosts, no supernatural goings-on, no girls with long black hair crawling backwards out of the television, and nothing in the loft. Think of it more as a terribly effective thriller, set in a very grim environment.<br /><br />To synopsise the plot, two men wake up chained to opposite walls of a disused men's room. There's a corpse laying dead in the centre of the floor, with a cassette player in his hand. Our two protagonists find cassettes in their pockets, personally addressed to them. And from there, they must piece together the events that have led up to their capture, as well as find a way out of their predicament before six o' clock... or else!<br /><br />Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) aren't great actors, so there's not a lot on offer for fans of carefully crafted performances. Some of the plot devices, too, feel a little familiar, once the movie gets going. And there's a lot of visual fluffing, in terms of flashy camerawork and overwrought flashback sequences. So what makes "Saw" work so well?<br /><br />Originality. The first thirty minutes of the movie are as affecting in their visual melancholia as they are in the amount of tension they succeed in building. Director James Wan's success in establishing the initial hopelessness and melancholia of the captives' situation is admirable, given that it's so simple. The story, too, is a more original version of a serial killer fable, and while the flashiness of the movie won't really cause you to mull over the nature of good and evil, there's certainly a strong backstory behind the events of the main film.<br /><br />Set-pieces are similarly original - think of a slightly less plausible version of 'Se7en' and you'll get an idea of what I mean. It's not a very gory movie, either, despite what you may have heard - but the imagery that Wan uses is very unsettling in places, and very effective because of this. And performance-wise, while the two leads won't win any oscars for this one, they're by no means bad actors, nor are they unsuccessful in setting out what the intend to do - personally, I was rooted to my seat from beginning to end, and, in a time where bad horror has made it nigh-on impossible for us to feel fear in the cinema anymore, that's no mean feat.<br /><br />All in all, "Saw" is highly deserving of praise for being a truly original and very effective movie. It's well-made, it's tense, and it's very compelling. While rental might be enough for most of us, the DVD extras are enough to warrant purchase, and all in all, I can recommend this one very highly.
I watched this film yesterday night alone in my home. It reminded me of my idea of myself probably being a victim of some superhuman power that controls my life. I'm the creator of Superultramodern Science (SS) / Philosophy(SP) and the inventor of the NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory. The theory, sometimes in conjunction with some other ideas in SS, implies that (probably) space is a form of illusion to non-spatial mind, and the human beings, including everything apparently conscious, I see, and I ever saw and shall see, around could simply be zombies, i.e. mere spatial images with no corresponding states of consciousness. My life is therefore a game which shall end in my death at some age (hopefully because of old age). However, to avoid that sort of end I must change the nature of the game, the design of my life, by controlling my states of consciousness. And the way to do this might be meditation. While  watching the film I really thought that `saw is life...'. (However, it doesn't really make much sense to tell you this because if, by chance, you are conscious you would know that I'm wrong and if you are not conscious then there is no point in telling my ideas to a zombie as s/he is just a spatial image with no possibility of understanding anything. But still what if we all are conscious and victims!) Anyways do see the film!!!
I prefer scary movies that are heavy on the suspense, light on the bloodshed, which is why I gave this movie 3 stars. This movie was very, very bloody. There were a couple of twists, to be sure, but I would say that the extreme grisliness outweighed the suspense.<br /><br />"Saw" made me think of a very long music video, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I did think that it borrowed a lot from "Seven", which starred Brad Pitt.
I am someone who grew up in the 80's and loved the classic gorey films such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th just to name but a few.  I seen the underground and the commercial ones. If I wasn't at my local independant theatre on weekends watching a horror and martial arts double feature I was renting them from my local shop that carried all the underground stuff you could think of. I lived and breathed horror films. My mother thought I was nuts. Then in the mid 90's censorship hit hard and the gore in horror films ran dry.  Then unfortunately so did the brains of most directors.  Special effects took over for story lines and soon there was nothing to think about.  When SAW came in to theatres I skipped it, not wanting to believe the hype. Seeing the posters for pt 2 everyday going to work got me intrigued.  Then I saw this dvd which was on sale and it came with a free movie ticket for part 2 so I figured how could I go wrong.<br /><br />Let me tell you.... I am so sorry that I missed this in theatres.  It is hard to shock me.  I seen it all but RARE is the movie that makes me comment out loud, drop my jaw and not want to move in fear of missing something.  SAW did it.  This is an incredible film.  Intense visualization, good acting, good amount of gore in consideration of how much is censored now a days and finally something to make you think as well. Jigsaw is definitely a killer worth the ranks of Jason, Freddy and Leatherface!  Buy this movie without a thought.  Plus there is a free ticket for part 2 which EXPIRES on Dec 9th.  How can you go wrong?
This movie centers on the idea that most people take their lives for granted and don't care how they treat others or even themselves. But a new serial killer on the loose is trying to change their minds. The killer puts people in situations that require a major moral dilemma in order for them to live. Sadly, the actors in this movie don't seem to be able to portray any of their emotions on a convincing level and that takes away from the movie. It is still worth renting though and perhaps even seeing 'Saw II' which is coming soon to the movie theaters.
I love movies that no nobody survive in them! except bad people! I'm seek of watching a hero or a victim survive each time! If you think like me, this is your movie! Everyone would die and psychophat would live! this is not a scary movie, It's a bloody movie! It got me revived, the only better movie I've ever seen is "The Texas Chinsaw Massacre (2004)"
About six or so months ago "Saw" was the four hundred pound gorilla rampaging through several of the horror websites I frequent. Every other day brought new photos, new links to trailers, new behind the scenes stories, and new conjectures all pointing to the incredible potential of this movie. Those insiders lucky enough to view the film before its general release spoke in reverent tones about the carnage we all would soon see with "Saw." They furthermore whispered words like "giallo" and "Argento" to describe the stylistic aspects of the movie. Needless to say I wanted to see this picture in the worst way after reading such high praise: I love films larded with gory carnage, love gialli, and think Dario Argento is one of the great horror masters of the modern age. Sadly, seeing "Saw" in the theater would not become a reality for me. In a tradeoff with my girlfriend that I will rue until the day I die, I agreed to attend a screening of the pedestrian "The Forgotten" instead of "Saw." I just got my revenge, however, by forcing her to watch the DVD edition of a film that I consider one of the best new horror films to come down the pike in quite some time.<br /><br />"Saw" begins by introducing us to two characters who will come to dominate most of the film's screen time: Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). The two men awake to find themselves chained to pipes in a phenomenally grungy bathroom with little knowledge of how they got there or why they are there. Then they start discovering clues: a corpse clutching a tape recorder and pistol lies in a pool of blood in the center of the room, envelopes containing cassette tapes lie in their pockets, hacksaws soon turn up, and a camera watches them from behind a two way mirror. It's obvious someone with a sick sense of humor placed these guys in this room with a purpose in mind, and that purpose gradually comes to the fore with horrific implications. Dr. Gordon suddenly recalls a series of incidents a few months before involving a serial killer named Jigsaw, a killer whose victims perish in extraordinarily graphic ways. It turns out that this murderer isn't an average stalk and slash psychopath, however, but a cunning sadist who thinks his mission is to teach others the value of life. He does so by placing them in traps that require the subject to overcome their flaws in order to escape. Adam and Gordon are definitely caught up in Jigsaw's latest shenanigans.<br /><br />Most of what we learn in "Saw" comes from flashbacks from Adam and Gordon. We learn that a Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) and his fellow investigators on the force tried to pin the crimes on Dr. Gordon when they linked a piece of evidence to the good doctor. We also discover that Gordon has a lot of family problems with his daughter and wife. Heck, it isn't too long before we realize that nearly every major character--Tapp, Adam, Gordon, and a couple of others--possesses some secret that hints at the possibility that any of these guys could be Jigsaw. And we learn more about Jigsaw, his strange philosophy, his haunts, and his stomach churning props. This killer locked one of his victims, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), in a helmet that could tear her head apart and demanded she look for the key in the most unusual of places. He's a warped, warped individual, but he's also a guy who keeps his word. If his victim escapes from his scheme they are free to reenter society, hopefully with a better outlook on the importance of life. "He helped me," claims Amanda, and it's disturbing to realize you understand exactly what she means.<br /><br />Jigsaw's philosophy is one of only a large number of massively disturbing elements in "Saw," but it's one of the more interesting ones. People say his stance on life mirrors the film "Seven," and perhaps that is so. I saw a greater similarity between Jigsaw's tortures and the scene in "Fight Club" where Tyler Durden uses the threat of death to force a young convenience store clerk to follow his dream of becoming a veterinarian instead of wallowing in apathy. The idea is to get people to wake up and start appreciating each and every day. If it takes a barbed wire trap or a bear trap helmet to bring the sheep to their senses, so be it. "Saw" offers us more than mere mental gymnastics, fortunately, including Cary Elwes hamming it up as the coolly aloof Gordon, a very creepy puppet used to great effect, and a scene with a flashbulb taken right out of the original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre." In fact, "Saw" rips off a lot of stuff from other classic horror films, but it does so in way that didn't bother me. Frankly, I like to see a movie paying homage once in awhile. What did surprise me was the gore, or lack thereof. This is the unrated cut? Where's the sauce? There are a few nasty surprises but "Saw" keeps most of the grue safely out of camera range. Pity.<br /><br />Extras on the widescreen edition disc disappoint. I kicked back before starting the behind the scenes feature, figuring that the whole thing would take twenty or thirty minutes to play out. It took TWO AND A HALF MINUTES! Then there's a music video and a short documentary about making the music video. The poster gallery and trailers section don't break new ground, nor does the commentary track from director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell. Who wants to bet a double dip special edition DVD will arrive in stores soon? Any takers? Nevertheless, "Saw" is definitely worth a watch; it's a fine film that blows away most of the mainstream horror coming out today.
Wow, I am surprised I could sleep well the night after I saw Saw... lol... I love the gore and the puzzle ideas. I sometimes sit alone and think of other puzzles that would be interesting to think about. I think that the ending was well thought out and wonderful. Twisted Pictures is so da bomb.
Saw isn't as good as the trailers make it look, but it's still a pretty darn good horror flick.<br /><br />The basic idea of the movie is that you've got two guys chained to opposite sides of a really dirty bathroom, and there's a dead guy laying in a pool of blood in the middle of the room. Neither of them have any idea how they got there or why they would be there.<br /><br />In the course of trying to find a way to escape, they begin to discover clues and we start to learn about both characters via flashbacks. We all know they have a saw and that it won't cut through the chains, only their flesh. Is that the only possible way out? You know I can't answer that question. In fact, there's not much more of the story that I can really talk about safely.<br /><br />The only actor you've likely seen before it Danny Glover, and some of the other actors aren't quite up to par during some scenes. We know they are supposed to be expressing horror or terror in some scenes, but it sure looks like they are trying not to laugh. That's ok though, the situations and ideas behind this movie make up for those types of shortcomings. Special effects? Eh, not so hot. There are some really cool sets, but the blood/gore factor isn't nearly as high as we had hoped. You're gonna have to use your imagination on some things. Lack of a budget or purposeful decision by the director? I'm going with the lack of budget argument.<br /><br />One thing this movie does exceptionally well, and this is why it's getting 4 stars instead of 3, is setting you up on who the bad guy really is. They throw out some obvious fakers, and some subtle hints on others so you think you have it all figured out. Then WHAM, nope, wasn't that guy... what about?... WHAM... nope, not him, what about... you get the idea. Did I figure out the ending in advance? Yes, but not until right up til the end, and these days that deserves a boost in the ratings.<br /><br />This one isn't for the squeamish even though it's not as graphic as others would like you to think. I do recommend seeing it on the big screen, and if you take a date with you you can expect lots of arm squeezing and head ducking. Come to think of it, that also might be worth another star.
If you read my reviews you know I tend to stay away from horror movies, even at my old age they give me the creeps.  However, my family tells me if they are going to watch the comedies with me, I must watch some horrow with them.  So....I sat and watched "Saw."<br /><br />I have to say it was quite a different beginning and really got my attention with the two men in the bathroom, just what was going on? We find out our killer is somewhat different than the 'norm,' whatever that maybe. He has a purpose,an intent in what he is doing and who he is doing it to. Now, to just figure out what that is and why. All of our victims have a chance of saving their lives, but will they pay the price to do it?<br /><br />I think the ending was the best, what a shocker that was.<br /><br />All in all, not too gory and really had a different storyline.<br /><br />Now on to the comedies!
Perhaps, Saw isn't a movie that I will add to my movie library any time soon.  Be that as it may, it no doubt asserts itself as a rather memorable movie nonetheless.  From the beginning, you are thrust into a sick milieu that will, if anything, grab your attention and not let go until the clever ending.<br /><br />While not great by any stretch, Saw is most definitely worth a look for those who enjoy Seven and the like.
Saw is not so much a "horror" movie as it is a combination of "suspense" and "shock value".  The plotline and creative camera-work and timing are unique and causes Saw to stand out amongst the plethora of generic gore films that Hollywood blows its load on every year, though the subpar acting of of several otherwise respectected stars makes the acting a hinderance to the story.<br /><br />It must be noted that this film is definately not for anyone with a weak stomach or who is succeptible to bouts of insomnia.  And it is ABSOLUTELY not for children.  This is not the stereotypical "I still have some issues with what you did last summer" mind dump.  The subject matter is meant for mature minds.<br /><br />Though not quite on par with others of its ilk, Saw can hold its own amongst such notable titles as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs, though some questionable directing and lamentable acting keep it just shy of movie nirvana.
...and if you do see it coming (I've talked to people who know some who have) then you need to take a break from the horror movies and get out more. It will probably catch most by surprise; it sure did me.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie if you're expecting a scare. It doesn't even really have the creep factor even. Don't watch it if you don't like bloody violence. Watch it, instead, for something unique to rub elbows with all the carbon-copy movies and things out there today. Everything nowadays seems to copy everything else, for better or worse. Who woulda thought a low-budget movie like Saw would come up and kick people awake from the monotony of sameness?<br /><br />Sure, the show has its faults. Acting, for one, is definately at best B-grade (that's being nice, too). However, it doesn't quite go to laughable territory, which is good. Some parts will make you reflect going, what were they thinking? But by the end, you should hopefully be surprised (and a little repulsed - it's called Saw, people...I'll give you five guesses on what happens.)<br /><br />One reviewer hinted that the reason they (DEFINES REASON FOR TITLE - SPOILER TO SOME???) didn't show the guy hacking his leg off (I sure don't think that's a spoiler, sorry if it is) is that budget restricted it. They expressed concern of a bigger budget for what must be the rumored Saw 2. Me, I express concern for a sequel to this movie, period. Two, I don't think they cut that (no pun intended) for money reasons. I think it may have been for ratings, people. By the end, plenty of brutalities has happened, and watching some guy rip his own foot off would probably push it past acceptable R-territory.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good one to rent once while its semi-new and talk with friends about. Definately not one to learn acting skills from, though :-)<br /><br />Warning to concerned: R for bloody violence (duh) some language Not for the little kiddies ("Mama, look! That guy is hacking is foot off!" Not good)<br /><br />Peace out
I had a female friend who thought about seeing this movie at a theater near the beach.  The question was should she see Saw by the seashore?<br /><br />Actually, beyond some puns, I'm not positive of the merit of this movie.  It is clever, probably too clever for its own good.  The story focuses on a serial killer who puts his victims in elaborate traps which over a minimal chance of escape.  Two men wake up to find themselves chained in a dingy bathroom in an abandoned building.  The only means of freedom are some rusty hacksaws which are just sharp enough to cut off a bound foot.<br /><br />Through flashback, we are introduced to an obsessed detective who is pursuing this killer.  While bright enough to pick up tiny clues, he is also inept enough to wander into this genius killer's lair without a real plan or backup (beyond a single partner).  This allows the killer to get away and engineer his next trap.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are not very many of these "dumb" moments, and in reality, the biggest problem with the movie is its convoluted nature.  For most of the movie, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, and knew it would come down to the inevitable final twist, which was neither good nor bad enough to generate any real reaction.<br /><br />One mark of a good movie is when you forget you're watching a movie:  with all the stylized direction and overly clever plotting, it's hard to get that absorbed in this film.  This is an interesting movie and not really a bad one, but it's also imperfect.  It also owes a lot to other movies, especially Seven, and you might be better off seeing those movies.  See Saw?  Some say si; I say you might enjoy it if you're a fan of these types of thrillers, but you might not.  I guess you could say I can't make up my own mind; I keep seesawing on Saw.
I've been eagerly anticipating the release of this DVD for some time since I missed it when it was out in theaters. I had heard all the bad press it got but refused to believe Danny Glover would make a bad movie. My opinion was proven right but his character is a bit obsessed in this movie. He plays one of the cops chasing the Jigsaw Killer. After seeing his partner be murdered, quite brilliantly I might add, he becomes obsessed with finding who the killer is even after being discharged. He is convinced that a man named Lawrence is the killer and stakes his place out. That's all I will say about his character. The movie starts off amazingly well, two men wake up in a room chained to pipes with a dead body in the middle of the room. It progresses rather quickly with Lawrence, a doctor, explaining about a few of the deaths to Adam. It may just be me but I didn't find Cary Elwes' (Lawrence) acting to be very believable at times. Leigh Whannell (Adam), however, was very convincing and made his character very understandable. The plot is about as good as you get in this day-and-age. A cheap rip-off of Seven? Maybe. But this movie is executed very well. It keeps you guessing throughout, even when you think you have everything figured out. The deaths featured in the film are gruesome and extremely raw, a nice visual compared to other movies' deaths. This movie also contains one of the best endings to a psychological/horror movie I have seen, you're jaw will be on the floor. Overall this movie is very enjoyable and doesn't stoop to the cheap scares as you might expect. The horror mounts throughout and is more in the atmosphere of the movie because you know what might happen and you just dread the thought of it. There's not enough movies with that aspect to it anymore, so for that alone, this movie is worth it. Worthy acting and a great plot only makes this movie better.
Plot is a bit sloppy but if you like "B" thrillers you should love this one.  Not for everyone and not I what I expected, but like it or not you will be talking about the ending for quite a while.
I was beyond interested in this film and got it right when it entered the video rental store. The entire film appeared to be so eeriee and I needed to know what was going on.<br /><br />I must say this film was a heart- stopping thriller. They cut to the chase right at the beginning of the film with the main character Adam waking up in an old bathroom chained to a pipe and across the room from him is a doctor whom says he just woke up himself and he is chained to a pipe as well. In the middle of the floor between them is a corpse that shot himself. Which tells you whoever put them down there means lethal business. A series of clues they find in that one bathroom leads them to find out much about what is going to happen to them and it doesn't look good on either side. I won't give anything away because the movie is just full of surprises and the viewer should be as shocked as I was in every one of them.<br /><br />Why this film is only given a three? Well in some parts of the film they really try to scare you by making some scenes go really quick and I found that a little tacky. At the end once more they gave you a cliff- hanger and like I mentioned probably in many films I don't really like that but the ending is really good and may I add nauseating because the doctor does something very horrific and I don't even want to think on it. You can see it for yourself. Just don't be eating dinner while watching it.<br /><br />The gist of this film? You'll never guess the ending. You can sit here now and think on it as hard as I did throughout the movie but you'll never figure out the ending. It is beyond twisted and you'll just be sitting there at the end in deep shock. Obviously the ending proves there will be a sequel so do not worry- the shock will only grip us till the second comes out.
"Saw" is the suspense horror film to buy on DVD for this first quarter of 2005. After hearing mixed opinions about the movie, I felt that there was only one thing to do, ..see the movie for myself. I wasn't among those that were disappointed. Although the acting was a bit rusted (not by all), it was easily tolerable. The film had plenty of suspense, chills, and thrills around every unexpected twist and turn. Sure, there are those who knew what was going to happen next, but did they really? I found the idea of the movie fresh. I welcomed each intense moment. I'm not much on breaking things down in a movie review. I just recommend them or not. In this case I recommend "Saw" to those who like well paced horror. However, if movies like "The Grudge" scare you. Avoid this and save money on a therapy  bill.
FORGET ALL THE REVIEWS YOU HAVE READ !! MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT ON THIS ONE! First this is not a movie that is supposed to be like "The Grudge" or "The Ring" . This movie is not supposed to be a horror movie instead it is VERY SHOCKING AND DISTURBING. But that's exactly the filmmakers planned to do. I am not going to say anything about the story because then I will ruin the plot. All I can say is that I have now another favorite film director. James Wan who seems to be a very young and fresh director brings amazing twists to this movie. All I can say is I can hardly wait till I see his next master piece. I was completely surprised by the movie. From the beginning till the bitter surprising ending. The entire movie is done in a awesome camera work and cutscenes. It is loaded with fresh and shocking ideas. If you cannot handle blood in the fim you should not watch this movie at all.
It's hard to know where to start with this movie. It's just so good. I guess it would be good to start off by saying that this movie is more than just props and imagery. It's very, very plot driven, with a story that will have you on the edge of you seat, screaming at the screen and droping your jaw at the ending. It's twist after turn, shock after scare. Not your typical horror, not your typical slasher. This movie is realy very psychological, and I think any one who likes a good mystery will get a kick out of it.<br /><br />But, any review of this movie wouldn't be a real review if it DIDN'T talk about the visuals. So many cool prop ideas are in the movie, from the puppet (who the creaters named 'Bill') to the pig mask to all the chilling murder scenes. This is where the movie gives horror fans what they really want. Also, Saw is not uptight when it comes to the blood, but not so much to just be 'slasher'. The blood doesn't drown out the story.<br /><br />I will have to admit, the acting by Cary Elwes is wretched, and he's the main character really, so that does hurt the film. Still, even his 'drama club' quality acting can't kill the blood chilling story.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, the bonuses leave a lot to be desired. No cut scenes and the 'making of' is pitiful. You learn more by listening to the commentary than by watching 'Sawed Off'. Saw is the type of movie that 'making of's were made for, and they really droped that ball there. Perhaps they're holding out for a collectors edition or some thing. I'd be pretty let down if that was the case.<br /><br />Lastly I have to mention the ending. Seriously...it's all about the ending. Well...not ALL about the ending, but...I was blown away. Just go see it. You wont be sorry.
SAW is a welcome relief to the serial killer film genre.  It is both clever and interesting. There is a lot to take in, but that is a good thing. It focusses on two men who wake up in an old change room/toilet chained to the plumbing.  But how did they get there.  It's all a puzzle, and I doubt any viewer could have seen the ending coming. Once again, very clever.<br /><br />SAW is the work of two Australian scripwriters, one of whom plays a lead role in the film. It was originally intended as a straight-to-video film but impressed the right people and gained a cinema run world-wide.  Rumoured to have been severely cut in places to enable a moderate rating, fans of the film will no doubt hope the DVD release features the full uncut version.  I will add that even the cut version is not for the squeamish.
So what is wrong with this movie? A gratuitous, if often successfully creepy exercise in sadomasochistic filmmaking, Saw features some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a mainstream film with an experienced cast. That is the film's undoing. Making something that could've been geniuinely creepy absolutely laughable! How far would you go to save your own life? Prepare yourself for a gut-wrenching trip into the heart of terror with SAW, Lions Gate Films' gripping horror film starring Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter and Leigh Whannell. Obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, a deranged, sadistic serial killer is abducting morally wayward people and forcing them to play macabre games for their own survival. Faced with impossible choices, each victim must struggle to win back his/her life, or else die trying...A young man named Adam wakes to find himself chained to a rusty pipe inside a decrepit subterranean chamber. Chained to the opposite side of the room is another bewildered captive, Dr. Lawrence Gordon Between them is a dead man lying in a pool of blood, holding a .38 in his hand. Neither man knows why he has been abducted, but instructions left on a microcassette order Dr. Gordon to kill Adam within eight hours. If he fails to do so, then both men will die; Dr. Gordon's wife, Alison and his daughter will also be killed. Recalling a recent murder investigation by a police detective named Tapp Dr. Gordon realizes he and Adam are the next victims of a psychopathic genius known only as "Jigsaw." With only a few hours left to spare, they must unravel the elaborate puzzle of their fate in the midst of mounting terror. The killer has provided them with only a few clues and two handsaws - too weak to break their steel shackles, but strong enough to cut through flesh and bone...Director James Wan expertly spins this intricate tale, creating a chilling landscape of dread where nothing is quite as it seems. An edge-of-your-seat ride bristling with emotional intensity, SAW will keep you guessing until the very end. However an experienced horror veteran like myself found it a bit unoriginal, but it had the right idea, just not execiution.
you have to realize this was a very low budget movie.  so they could not afford a great actor for dr. gordon.  for what they spent on this, it is an excellent movie.  the ending was the best part.  when you go and see this, just set aside criticisms for the acting and you will really enjoy this one.  it should not be compared to seven or phone booth.  the people comparing it are obviously one-minded goons who can't appreciate movies for what they are.  also, if you like hapy endings, you may not like this.
I dont see why so many people are putting this movie down. I guess it is because they were expecting more gore then was actually in the movie, and that may be because the critics and previews made it seem that way. Dont get me wrong, this movie does have its bloody parts, but its not that bad and its not nonstop violence. Now for the positives i would definatly say this is very original plot and you'll never guess who the killer actually is at the very end. The story is very good and there's lots of suspense(i dont know how you could fall asleep watching it because it at least has a good story, even if it's not that gory). It is quite entertaining and demented, and James Wan(the director)did a good job on his first movie. See it and watch it with an open mind and dont put it down because its not that gory, because i've seen pleanty of gory movies that suck and thats because it didn't have a good plot(example:Candyman)Thank you and enjoy the movie!
This was probably one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched, especially with all the hype surrounding it.  My friends insisted that this was a horrifying movie, and they were right- just not in the way I expected. The only horrifying thing about this movie is the acting done by a tired and bloated looking Cary Elwes.  Past that, the movie just doesn't make any sense.  And so far as the plot twists that so impressed my friend, they're juvenile and easy to guess or just silly.  Wait for this one to come out on a premium cable channel and save your money.
I rented this and what can I say? Well... you can't use that type of language here at Amazon but I'll just go with it...<br /><br />Awful acting? Check.<br /><br />Awful story? Check.<br /><br />Awful direction? Check.<br /><br />Awful villian? Check.<br /><br />Awful chemistry? Check.<br /><br />Awful ending? Check.<br /><br />To have this movie as a 3.5 star average and to even have ONE five star rating is a crime against God, humanity, and cinema... and maybe not in that order. If you are the brainless sort that finds Fear Factor to be "good television" then by all means, buy this NOW.
I was sure that it would be really scary; however I was wrong. It is one of those movies which do not raise your heartbeat and do not have any real special effects. You can buy it maybe for your DVD collection, bout do not pay too much.
This was a good movie, but the second one totally kicks this ones ass. But you should watch the first before you see the second or you'll be sorta lost. basically watch both of them.
I've heard so many good (and not so good) reviews of this, I've been teetering between either buying or renting. Well, I just bought this and wait until you see the packaging - there's actual blood sealed inside the front, clear cover and it moves all around!! Not only that, but there's a minature saw blade that moves too. It defintely pushed me over the edge. Hopefully the movie is as good (especially "uncut") and creative as the package it came in. I'll know soon enough. If only more studios had it in them to be this inspired (and willing to spend the cash).
This little horror movie is full of tricks that'll grip you to your sofa. 2 people bound to the wall of a real damp and a corpse... They're the target of a mysterious serial killer. This one's got a real sick imagination. Behind the pictures and the clever-horrible scenes, there is a question about the survival instinct. And an interrogation will occur to you: "What would you do if you were the killer's target?"<br /><br />"Saw" is a refreshing change from the classic plot of the white face serial-killer pursuing a naive girl in the woods. It IS scary. And it's smartly directed.<br /><br />And if you're a fan of "Usual suspects" like ending, you'll get a psychotic one!<br /><br />It's horrible, it's nauseous and it doesn't end well.<br /><br />Want to try?
This another extraordinary film that did not due too well during its theatrical release, but I highly recommend. However, this film is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The film revolves around a serial killer who doesn't kill people himself; but rather, places people in intricate situations which require difficult decisions to be made in order to stay alive.<br /><br />The victims selected are not the pillars of society. It's this collection of individuals, which is the key to the whole plot of this film and eventually the identity of the killer. These people are throwing away the one true thing the killer cherishes, and that's live itself. So they are forced to prove their right to life in an elaborate set of tests or die trying.<br /><br />I would categorize this film as a thriller; however, the killings do have a touch of gore to them. I love films that stretch the imagination and develop new and exotic ways to tell an age old story, and this film does just that.<br /><br />The film's title is a foreshadowing of things to come from almost the beginning of the film. Two complete strangers Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell wake up in a dark, and dingy bathroom only to find themselves chained by their legs to separate walls of the room. While rummaging around the room, a sack is found and in it are two hacksaws. The hacksaws are not strong enough to cut through the chains which are binding our main characters, what do you suppose the hacksaws are to be used?<br /><br />At the same time, Danny Glover plays a cop also searching for our mysterious killer, commonly referred to as Jigsaw because of these complex games he forces his victims to play.<br /><br />Again, the gruesome murder scenes almost elevate this film to a horror flick. However, the well told story line, elaborate plot, and the plot twist at the end; will leave you completely satisfied that you viewed this movie.<br /><br />http://farisreel.com
This film is great. One would compare it to Se7en, however the horror is more explicit. The story is brilliant, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire length of the film. This is definitely a must see. And what a sick mind the writer must have :-)
I left this DVD on top of the TV for about 2 weeks before I got the guts to watch it. I noticed the rating was for GRISLY VIOLENCE and, as I get older, I find I don't have the same stomach that I had as a youth.<br /><br />Finally, I sat down and watch this film, and it was AWESOME.<br /><br />I was very impressed by how tight this film was and how the story unfolded, and the twists and turns. I knew a bit about what the movie was about and found it to be very tense the entire flick. But the story flowed smoothly, the editing was really well done. I was a little depressed at how fast everything wrapped up at the end, because it could have lasted a bit longer, but the last minute twists were great.<br /><br />I would like to see the NC-17 version or director's cut next.<br /><br />FANTASTIC movie, but not for kids.
FAR SUPERIOR to "7" ~ this misbegotten gem takes you via flashback through various 'entertainments' .... [with due respect to "7"].... a thoroughly nasty little journey through the mind of the severely unhinged ....<br /><br />Fave moments??  The gal wearing the Hannibal Lecter {literally} ripoff mask [with a vague difference].<br /><br />FOR sheer perversion we should receive a sequel [unlikely] but wouldn't it be fun???<br /><br />NOT to be missed ~ especially the beloved puppets!<br /><br />REALLY something for the extremely 'shunned'.<br /><br />GREAT moments aplenty ........
"Saw" is a really creepy film that starts off creepy and ends creepy. The acting is good, until the doctor starts yelling out his wifes name too loud, then it gets hilarious. I cannot even remember the characters names, that is how unforgetable the characters were. The storyline, however, was the best part of the film. A murderer makes people go through obstacles that will end up the person in the predicament killing themselves just to survive. The film, though, was gross. An overweight man having to climb through a maz of barb wire. Then the detective later says, "It cut him so deep that we found traces of stomach acid on the floor." Nasty. The only character that I cared about was the doctor's wife and little girl because they did not deserve for that to happen to them. The doctor and the photographer who took pictures of the doctor were not the best characters, and the actor's who portrayed them did not do a good job. My favorite character, however, was the girl who had to cut the key out of a supposedly dead guys stomach to unlock the headset that was attached to her jaw. If she did not accomplish this, the headset was going to snap and break off her jaw, causing her death. The guy, though was not dead, and she had to murder him. It was extremely disgusting, though, when it showed her pulling out his intestines. At the end, though, the doctor has to cut off his foot to get away, and it even shows him start to cut. The murderer, though I will not give it away, was witty. I would have never guessed that it would be that person. The film, overall is getting three stars from me because the storyline was excellent, but I did not care if the main characters were to die or not. They were not that likable anyway.
Apparently, "Saw" is a movie people either hate or love.  I thought it was great as it put an new twist on the psycho killer/horror genre.  Sure, people are saying it's a ripoff of "Seven" but it's really not - other than the killer has an imagination and the director of the film has an amazing way with visuals.  Directed and written by two Australians, one of whom (Leigh Whannell) also makes his film debut as one of the "Jigsaw Killer"'s victims, I thought this an extremely creepy film.  Whoever did the production design did an excellent job - just "The Helmet" sequence alone was enough to freak me out.  And that...MASK!!!  Also, the question the movie poses:  What WOULD it take for you to mutilate yourself/kill another/etc. to ensure your own survival and/or that of your loved ones was something to ponder.  There are some great twists in the film and, for such a low-budget effort (filmed in 18 days!!), a great cast (Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter), all to scare the hell out of you!!  Ignore the "professional" reviewers and just go rent this movie - it IS a good one!!
I've read some reviews, and frankly I'm disappointed by some of these opinions. First off, Saw was brilliantly well done. I think this is one of those films that's too clever for it's own good(Just like "Back To The Future II").<br /><br />  The movie begins with an abrupt introduction to two men held captive in a room in "God knows where". There is Dr. Lawrence(Cary Elwes), and Adam(Leigh Whannell). For whatever reason everyone seems to be complaining an awful lot about Leigh Whannell's acting, or the entire cast's acting in general. I wouldn't call it great, but I also wouldn't go as far as calling it "B-Rated". For his first acting gig, Leigh Whannell actually did a good job, and he had some really funny lines to boot: "All I know is that I fell asleep in my s**thole apartment, and I woke up in an actual s**thole". If anyone deserves the credit of being a bad actor, it would be Monica Potter, who unconvincingly plays an angry, oversuspecting wife to Dr. Lawrence. She literally has one signifigant line in the movie, and plays it off poorly.<br /><br />  The plot, however, was brilliant, but even brilliance has it's flaws(Face it, you know you have a favorite movie of all time, and I'm sure you can point out it's flaws that you choose to overlook because the movie is so damn good.) The flaws are few and far between, but can easily be overlooked thanks to all the twists and turns that this movie takes. But nothing could prepare me for the ultimate final twist. The build up to that very twist makes my heart pump so hard, I can feel the pulses in my chest.<br /><br />  All in all, the movie isn't in your face scary, but it may strike your "fear of the unknown" to kick in. All you know is that something sadistic is taking place on screen, and you can do nothing but let the pieces slowly but surely fall into place.<br /><br />  This movie's biggest flaw is that it may be to smart for it's own good, and I'm sorry but when it comes to this film: WOW!!!
For those of us who are tired the masked killer running around with a knife only to turn out to be an everyday teenager, you will be glad to see Saw. This movie is classified as a "horror" movie but it is very very intense as well. There is no one running up stairs instead of out of the front door type of situations, only those who keep you on the edge of your seat. There have been many complaints on the acting, yes, some is a bit exaggerated but you can't help to think about what you would look like if you were in that situation.<br />I was very impressed with the plot, considering most horror movies forget to add those in the mix of blood shed and screams. The movie will definitely leave you guessing and your heart racing. Don't be fooled by the room they are locked in, the entertainment value is ten times greater than when Tom Hanks got deserted on an island (Cast Away) and scuba divers got left in the ocean (Open Water).<br />Overall this is one of the best horror movies I have seen. I believe it opens up a whole new world of opportunity for movies that can get to their viewer mentally. The scariest thing of all in this movie is that it can actually happen, unlike Jason coming back over and over. And if you have trouble sleeping after a horror movie, watch this in pure daylight, because you'll be afraid to go to sleep in fear of where you might wake up. See Saw.
When I saw this movie in the theatres, I left thinking with mixed thoughts.  On one hand, this movie is incredibly raw and visceral.  It gets under your skin with its disturbing images and ideas.  On the other hand, we have the most horrible acting jobs by some very talented AAA actors.<br /><br />Danny Glover plays a cop who is tracking the Jigsaw killer.  Cary Elwes is playing one of the possible victims of said killer who finds himself locked in a dingy restroom with two people, one in the center of the room who apparently blew his brains out and another unfortunate soul locked on the other end of the restroom.<br /><br />It seems that the Jigsaw killer has been kidnapping people and finds ingenuously creepy ways for them to kill themselves.  He never really does the act of it, but makes it so that it's virtually impossible for one to survive.<br /><br />That is the premise for the movie, and I won't spoil anything else.  Part of the reason I liked this movie was because of the pacing.  I found the movie to be expertly paced, with mounting tension and a lot of dread.  You wonder how or even if the two victims will ever make it out alive.  The other reason I enjoyed the movie was the way it set up the past of former victims and current victims, even pulling in Danny Glover's character in interesting ways.  There is a thread that holds everyone together and I found it incredibly fascinating.<br /><br />One thing reviewers have aptly mentioned is the gore.  This movie was a few shots over the R rating and had to be scaled down.  It is not for the squeamish.  If you've seen Se7en, you'll understand a portion of what the movie has to offer.  It's actually very surreal like Se7en and I think that movie is the closest I can compare to Saw.<br /><br />So, we have great pacing, good actors, an interesting (if ultimately unplausable in some spoiler aspects which I won't mention) story, good gore and some nice suspence.  What holds it back?  The acting.  The acting is amateurish in spots and really detracts from at least two major scenes.  Where it really hurts the movie is at the climax.  This is supposed to be a fearsome, horrible, scary moment and instead I laughed because of Cary Elwes.  I hate to say it, but it really ruined what suspense had been building.<br /><br />My other complaint with the climatic moment involving the title stems from a very sudden change in the character.  You know it's going to happen because it's been talked about constantly.  Yet, the motivation for the character to do it seemed a bit forced.  I think it would have been much much more effective if we saw the GRADUAL drive towards the act, not an instant jump.  I think his character could have been more effectively developed.  But that is just a preference as a plot buff.<br /><br />My 4 star review, then, comes from the fact that the movie was done a very small budget.  They shot the entire movie in 18 days because they could not afford any longer.  That means that each scene was not really a "final cut."  Instead they had to go with first or second takes simply because of funding.  The acting becomes understandable under that constraint.<br /><br />In the end, this movie doesn't have many jump out, cheap scares.  It has a more subtle terror that gets under your skin and makes you look under your car and in your closet before you go to sleep.  It's terrifying in a non-normal Hollywood way.  It's in your face and visceral.  In all honesty, if you like crime thrillers like Se7en, if you like horror movies, and if you aren't squeamish, then this is definitely a horror movie to see.  There are enough twists and turns and suspense to overshadow the poor acting.  Recommend a rent and possibly a buy.
For those tired of the "California-teens-are-picked-off-one-by-one" horror/thriller film premise should find much pleasure in "Saw." From the get-go, "Saw" is a disturbing game of master and servant as "the Jigsaw Killer" rounds-up disenchanted individuals and makes them pay for their own carelessness. A man who tried to take his own life by slicing his wrist was forced to decide on whether to die in a cell or navigate a path through barbed wire to reach the exit to freedom. A sort of test for these people who've previously made horrible choices in their life. Even the female early on in the movie who managed to get away from the killer (via succeeding in HER game) said that the experience changed her for the better.<br /><br />A twisted vigilante for sure, but the evil lead doesn't tug on anyone's sympathies for long as "Adam" and "Lawrence" are forced to work together (yet against each other) to stay alive.<br /><br />While the acting amongst all characters isn't exactly Oscar-quality, you can't go into the movie thinking that's what's to be expected. This is an extraordinarily unique movie and should be treated as a morbid look at the human condition in times of stress and life/death. As well, the creepy games (like the one Mr. Suicide played above) that the victims must play in order to live are creative and compelling.<br /><br />Fans of Rockstar Games' "Manhunt" should enjoy "Saw" immensely, by the way. The Jigsaw Killer and the Director from said game are very similar in approach and technique.<br /><br />Do not, however, be fooled by the grisly imagery of the DVD cover or any other mediums used to advertise the movie. This isn't a bloodbath. Some may be disturbed by the content, but most horror-philes should find it tame.
As someone who is admittedly addicted to horror films, I'd like to think I've seen it all. But every now and then, a movie comes along, takes me by surprise, and knees me in the groin. "Saw" is that film. From beginning to end, this movie is pure intensity. Directed by the young James Wan, who is just getting started in the business (and got one helluva headstart with this movie), "Saw" revolves around two seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) who wake up opposite of each other in a dirty, stinky, sketchy old bathroom, chained to the pipes and with a dead body loafing in between them. It seems that someone is playing a game with them, someone who selects the players in his game for a reason. He doesn't actually kill these people himself, but somehow, they end up dead (sound familiar, Kevin Spacey fans?). Hot on his trail, in a simultaneous subplot is Detective David Tapp (played by Danny Glover), who has a has a vendetta against one of the men trapped in the room. The movie moves at a brisk pace. It is absolutely unrelentless and virtually humorless. There isn't a moment where the movie sags, or where you, the viewer, can relax. Everytime you think you've wrapped your head around this movie, a curveball is thrown at you, straight up until the knock-out ending. I really can't explain much more about the plot without ruining parts of the movie. No doubt, this movie bares similarities with "Se7en," both in the story (which was also penned by Whannell) and in Wan's directing style. However, instead of coming off as derivitive, Wan uses his obvious influences to paint a totally different picture. He uses some stark, nightmarish images to full effect (check out the child abduction scene...how creepy) and turns old cliches (Adam's apartment scene) on their heels. The story, and more importantly, the characters are what's important here. Whannell created two very different, flawed, but sympathetic leads that we really start to care for, despite whatever events unfold (I saw a little of myself in Adam). Overall, I can't find a flaw in this film. It is just mind-blowing. It is perfectly crafted. Every little shot in this movie is in there for a reason, so pay attention. "Saw" is more than just your average thriller, and it doesn't reduce to splatterfest either (although there are some grisly scenes). Easily the best horror flick to come out last year. Fans of the genre should not miss it. The DVD is a little disappointing, with the mere highlight being the insightful commentary from Wan and Whannell. Also included is a feature, albeit brief, on the making of the movie, along with two versions of Fear Factory's "Bite The Hand That Bleeds" video and a making of the video segment. Pretty skimpy for a landmark release like this. I smell a re-release on the horizon (?).
I liked this movie a lot, I don't get all the negative reviews. However, I have a different complaint than most people though: I would really have liked to see more people fall victims of this killers elaborate traps (I would have liked to seen more traps) More gore please. Even though it did give some good gore, it just teased me.<br /><br />I think people didn't like this movie because of the ending, which I liked a lot. Or people are just crying because they couldn't figure out the ending. You cannot win, people either cry when a movie is predictable, or they cry when it doesn't follow the norm. Make up your mind morons. Anyway, it filled part of my gore meter, so I was happy with it. Loved the ending
Great flick. Marginally disturbing.<br /><br />Original. Never been done before. And done well.<br /><br />If you like this genre - this is a must-see. One of the best endings ever. Ever. Check it out.
It's become very clear that hollywood has ran into a monster<br /><br />creative wall. This movie is just trying to take advange of<br /><br />another little "horror" era that probably started with The<br /><br />Ring a few years ago. This is a rather predictable movie as<br /><br />even my moronic brother in law seen who the "killer" was just<br /><br />shortly after he appeared in the film.<br /><br />The main focus on the movie is two guys with one being a<br /><br />doctor and the other guy gets paid to snoop and take<br /><br />pictures of other peoples business. The movie for the most<br /><br />part goes for shock value. Not that I mind, but it's just<br /><br />that the movie isn't as deep/dark and scary as it wants to<br /><br />be. There are a few original ideas like "the head vice" but<br /><br />for the most part the movie just takes bits and pieces from<br /><br />other movies of the genre and puts them together.<br /><br />I'd have to say the acting is the worst. Cary Elwes is just<br /><br />an aweful actor in this film. How could the director  allow<br /><br />such pathetic work? Did Cary just come THAT cheap? Even<br /><br />Danny Glover was bad in this one! It is sad because even<br /><br />though it steals from other movies it could have been alot<br /><br />better. The acting and bits in pieces seem abit to rushed.<br /><br />And we can't forget the car scene. What's up with that?<br /><br />As somebody said, why not just have a few cut scenes? It's<br /><br />much easier and less annoying.<br /><br />However, even with the bad acting and unoriginal ideas<br /><br />even a poor mans Se7en is better than alot of movies in<br /><br />this genre nowdays. You would probably be better off to<br /><br />wait until this comes in HBO though. It simply isn't<br /><br />worth the money. It will will help out a spoof movie in<br /><br />the future though.
I saw this movie at the theater and was VERY impressed with the storyline.  However, the cinamatography was not very well done but overall it's worth watching.  I am waiting for it to come out on DVD so I can get it for my mom who loves a good thriller film.
This is another instance where hype leads to disappointment. Saw was a big "word-of-mouth" film when it came out in theaters. It was supposedly "different". Not typical horror, more of a mix of twisted psychological horror, suspense, and whodunit. It wasn't a gore fest by any means (although it's pretty darn gruesome at times). And some people loathe it for that because they expected copious amounts of blood and gore, and Saw didn't really deliver that.<br /><br />Its story and devices smack of "The Abominable Doctor Phibes", or the serial killer movie "Se7en" ... even a scenario from "Suspiria" is borrowed. "Saw" plays with several genres including the detective story. It comes off at first viewing as engaging but truly it's not a fun movie by any means. Some horror movies are fun because they are truly scary and entertaining. Saw is not entertaining enough or truly scary; it's fairly suspenseful and feels tantalizing in its puzzles, but it needs more than that to succeed. But to be fair, when you consider that this was a low budget indy movie, its tremendous success is really impressive.<br /><br />I'm not going to describe the premise or plot too much. Too many reviews for Saw start by saying "These two guys wake up chained to a pipe in a disgusting bathroom..." and they begin to delve into a nutshell synopsis. You'll find out what it's about when you watch it.<br /><br />Saw doesn't really quite know what it is, or what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie? Some say yes, others deny it vehemently. Yes, it's stylish enough (but sometimes the silly sped-up cinematography gets too obvious, like the film is trying hard to be cool), and the twisted scenarios that the psycho has dreamed up are pretty disturbing. But there seems to be not really enough meat here. When it's finished we are left feeling a bit empty... like what we just experienced was just an exercise in sadism, and not much more. And the entire story falls apart when carefully scrutinized. It's a bit disappointing when you see so much potential at the start, and then witness the movie fizzling/struggling until its surprise ending.<br /><br />Bottom line: worth a look for horror buffs, but overall nothing to scream about.
I am not a fan of the slash and gore genre, but through some persuasion, my daughter got me to agree to watch Saw. Talk about quality time. It is a story of psychological and physical torture and is done reasonably well. It crosses back and forth between cheesy B movie and A material. The story of a pair trapped in disgusting and strange circumstances with the promise of release if one murders the other, it unfolds with a beautiful plot twist at the end. If you accept the premise it has gratuitous violence you can see past that to a well-crafted tale.<br /><br />Cary Elwes has a bit of a time suppressing his English accent, and his acting is somewhat corny. But it adds to the effect that the movie is low budget and to the expectation of creepy and unexpected things. Danny Glover puts in a good performance as the crazed and monomanical cop.<br /><br />I give three stars, meaning above average, because it has entertainment value and some elements of cinematic art.
After all the shlock, schlock, horror, horror that gets churned out these days, we have an offering that is truly genuine, fresh and bloody frightening.<br /><br />The terror comes in the form of reality. Not far-fetched, not supernatural, and no special effects.<br /><br />RAW, UNCUT and GRISSLY.<br /><br />We are forced to examine the PRIMAL INSTINCTS within in order to survive.<br /><br />The question is, if you were locked in a room with a stranger and were told : To survive, kill the other person in the room. As simple as that! We'll, that's what's not so simple is it. Could you do it? You've got the whole movie to think about it!!!<br /><br />Danny Glover, Cary Elws and Monica Potter star in this low budget, but spectacular and exceptionally clever film.<br /><br />Elwes is chained up in a dark bathroom with a stranger and has to work out how to get out in order to save his family!!! The two are played against each other in a series of games in order to get the one to do the unthinkable. The story reveals that neither of them are in fact total strangers nor are they both entirely innocent.<br /><br />Written and Directed by first time "nobodies" - LEIGH WHANNELL & JAMES WAN : who believe me after this are going somewhere. Names will be in bright lights soon!<br /><br />JIGSAW is the warped psychopath pitting everyday people against the impossible in order to survive! Chances of making it - very slim unless you do what you'd never even dream of attempting.<br /><br />The film is very unsettling and most will battle to sit through it... but I highly recommend seeing it.<br /><br />It really is a MASTERPIECE and hopefully the already highly talked about sequel will keep the same pace and same originality and not conform to the basic sequel rules that turn so much of the garbage we see these days into the quickly forgotten. This one will haunt you for a while.<br /><br />Oh, and please hold on for the ending. It'll take your breath away!!!
The first few minutes of the movie is plagued with both poor dialog and poor acting, but gradually the movie starts to come together until the conclusion - by which time it has evolved into an excellent movie. Introducing experienced actresses like Dana Meyer ("Star Ship Troopers", "Bats") and Shawnee Smith ("The Blob") certainly helped with the acting (Shawnee is the girl in the trailer reel who survives)! Ultimately, this psychopath is so brilliant that he makes Hannibal look infantile! If you liked "Silence of the Lambs", then this is a MUST see movie.
I only have one thing to say for this film scary as hell. Watch the ending you wont sleep for weeks!!!!!
The challenge of making a convincing film is greatest for horror than for any other genre. It is no small task trying to legitimately engage and frighten audiences jaded by decades of mostly predictable and silly horror flicks. That "Saw" comes so close to succeeding on these fronts speaks volumes for its unexpected quality. Surely this film suffers from the usual horror movie flaws: overacting, a preposterous plot, dumb lines and gore that is far more disgusting than it is scary. But those who accuse "Saw" of being derivative -- specifically, a rip-off of the superior "Seven" with Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman -- simply misunderstand horror movies. What horror movie is NOT derivative, except for works like Dario Argento's "Suspiria", perhaps? All of the cult classics, from "The Hills Have Eyes" to "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Last house on the Left," the motif never veers too far from its basic premise: group of friends goes on adventurous excursion, enjoys a fleeting taste of freedom,innocence and exhiliration, and is then led terribly astray by unforeseen circumstances. Despite the success that motif has occasionally delivered over the years, "Saw" relies on a far more complicated and meticulous story brimming with fascinating details and psychological inquiry. Some of the acting is predictably awful, and the script is not the most intelligent or sincere piece of writing -- but then how inteligent is it to expect something cerebral of a horror flick (Polanski aside)? I am not apologizing for "Saw," for it needs no apology. The film really does speak for itself. It is not quite the classic it might have been and the plot can sometimes come close to falling from the threads that suspend it, but it is vastly superior to most of the mere kitsch and marketing that passes for "horror" today -- stuff like the recent Texas Chainsaw remake or "Dracula 2000," which ranks as some of the worst filmmaking in cinematic history. "Saw" hardly belongs in that category, and was well worth the 6 bucks I coughed up to see it. If you leave your conventional skepticism at the door and absorb "Saw" for what it is, I guarantee satisfaction.
For what is supposed to be a horror movie, I did not find it scary at all.  Instead I found it annoying and boring.  The two actors are either wrong for the roles or just did not know what they were doing.  What were they thinking when they made this ugly movie?
Saw is one of the worst psychological thriller/horror film I have seen since Kiss the Girls.  It is pseudo-Harrision, tedious, and the writers obviously did not dwell in the research department for long while writing the script.  The plot is outlandish, unbelievable, and ultimately retarded.  Not only would a person not go to the great lengths and means to achieve his ends depicted in the film, but a person could not plausibly do any of the exaggerated actions depicted in the film.  I have heard many people say that this is the most disturbing film they have seen in a long time, and I can agree with that so long as they are disturbed by the fact that this film was actually made.  In a nutshell, Saw was a complete and utter waste of time.
This movie is seriously a joke! The editing is horrificly bad, the set design is way over the top. . . I mean come on, how could ever square inch of every "scary" room have "perfect" lighting?! It's ridiculous. Cary Elwes gives his absolute worst performance ever. . . . and compared to the films he's done, I guess this would be his best. He, as well as every character in this huge blunder, is completely unbelievable, and the production is as good as a middle school talent show. I cannot believe Hollywood puts as much funding as they do into material this atrociously bad. Shame on you if you waste any of your life on trying to dive into the mess-up called "Saw"
This movie was a waste of time and energy. Filled with pointless, disturbing violence, it was made only worse by a flakey storyline and irritating characterisation. It just made no sense! Come on! a sick man in hospital organising gruesome killings so that the victims learn to appreciate life. Then he's lying still for over 7 hours pretendng to be dead (the guy with his brains blown out) so he observe his victims. Then at the end of the film he walks out of the room. This movie was sick, and I suspect only sickos would appreciate it. Why isn't it possible for people to ban these kinds of movies in the first place, - that glorify filth, murder & moral degeneration? An ungenerous review for a morally depraved and ungenerous film.
One of the 5 best horror films I've seen, "Saw" ranks with such classics as "The Exorcist," "Jaws," and "Alien." Director Wan plunges the audience in "medias res," dispensing with amenities or unnecessary introductions to present Whannel's story in a way that is reminiscent of Poe's best horror tales. The technique ensures that the viewer is always part of the action by setting up a tension that continues seamlessly to the final scene. Whannel demonstrates his writing expertise by offering his viewers a story line that carries them on an emotive experience to keep them vacillating between fear and hope.<br /><br />Whannel's writing always maintains the mystery of his plot. His method of guarding his mystery is not obscurantism or over-complication. Instead, he provides an interactive dialog between character and audience that forces the audience to participate in trying to make sense of the central dilemma. Wan supports the story through flashbacks and artful cinematography, making revelations that give the audience hope that they are on the verge of solving this entangled mystery. And at each turn of the plot, Wan jolts the audience back to the fear that the mystery might never be revealed. The soundtrack is unobtrusive, yet it functions as an unconscious energy that keeps the viewer focused.<br /><br />Whannel's choice of the name Adam for his own role evokes the "loss of innocence" myth from the first Book of the bible, "Genesis." And his choice of the name John for the role played by Tobin Bell, evokes the myth from the last Book of the bible, "Revelations." Together these two classic myths hint at Whannel's philosophical message about life-and the true meaning of horror.<br /><br />The only minor criticism I can offer is that I would prefer to have seen the role of Dr. Gordon played by an older, darker, and more seasoned actor like Dan Hedaya. But the collaboration of Wan and Whannel produced a 21st century horror classic that offers excellent writing, directing, cinematography, editing, and acting. It is a "must experience."
the story of two men who wake up in a room chained with no means of escape.  the plot thickens as the movie progresses and the back story introduces us to the "jigsaw killer" who finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.  i put this move on par with se7en.  it is a sick twisted and wonderful trip.  the end had my head spinning.  truly an awesome piece of cinema.  i disagree with some of my other reviews, especially amazon's but this is all my opinion.  i think screenwriter Leigh Whannel (who plays adam, one of the trapped men) does a amazing job especially at the end.  Cary Elwes also chimes in a great performance especially at the end.  Danny Glover adds to the cast as a cop pursuing the killer.  the cast is amazing and supports the story well and director James Wan has written a great psycodrama of a movie.<br /><br />  i would also like to address the reviewer Rosa La Luna who said that the movie Cube was "far superior".  Cube was a great move but comparing these two movies is like comparing apples and oranges.  Cube was not scary at all, and i doubt it wa smeant to be.  there was not one moment was i scared, curious how it ends but never was i scared like i was in Saw.  Saw is brutal, thought provoking, and one of the most disturbing films i have ever seen.  Cube was entertaining at best.  i was shocked to see so many bad reviews of this movie.  i loved it so mich i bought it.  i guess everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br /><br />  as for the dvd there are some cool features/behind the scenes but it is short.  they could have done better there
I just cant belive the guy who said, what about this, how does that guy didnt do,,, come on ITS A MOVIE and a very good one.<br />scaryyyyyy, good plot, nice ending. I PUT IT ALONG SE7EN IN ONE OF THE GREATEST ENDINGS EVERRR....<br />GO AND GET IT if you dare. jejejejeje
I dont know whether the makers of the Saw were really influenced by the 2 films i mention in the title of this review. But the parallels are very obvious to anyone who's seen them.<br /><br />As 2 people wake up chained to the walls of a toilet of an abandoned factory with a corpse lying in the middle of the room, the expectable questions arise in their minds: "How did we get here". "What's going on?". "Who is that corpse". Soon they find out that they've become a central piece in the game of a psycho who's teaching them a lesson which they don't understand. We as viewers are given more clues to figure it all out than they have, but as the thread unreels we have a disturbingly lingering sense that what we are let to know is pure deception. Their choices? To either kill each other or free themselves by sawing off one of their chained legs.<br /><br />  Sounds like this could get pretty gory, correct? Not really, as the main premise of the "Saw" is a purely mental one, in the sense that it's more aiming to be a sarcastic mindgame on the viewer rather than a cheap thrill gorefest. The violence is mostly implied and the violent scenes are actually few (keeping in mind what this could've become).<br /><br />  The film succeeds with flying colours in its mission then, as noone will easily resist trying to find out who the evil game-maker is. But as the clues pile up and the atmosphere goes from dark to darker so do the twists. Speaking of twists, there are so many here that the script writer walks a very thin line actually. The storyline is in danger of tipping over any single minute but this is a job ultimately well done. Aside of one single plot mistake (albeit sizey)  that i spotted right at the very end, the rest of the film is actually rock-solid. And even this one mistake will be inevitably excused because "Saw" offers a tremendous ride throughout to those that like their minds tested.<br /><br />  This is then the best asset of the film. It's not just a mere "whodunnit" flick but also a very stylistic dark film that will surely enter the pantheon of great thrillers in recent time.<br /><br />  The atmosphere keeps being in heavy competition with the excellent plot and in the end noone really cares who wins that contest. You want to see the story unraveling and you become increasingly addicted to the darkness oozing out of the screen.<br /><br />  On top of that, with the exception of Danny Glover, the main characters are wisely chosen to be 2 not known actors who do a more than just decent job delivering their parts. The dialogue is up to par with the rest of the film and overall "Saw" wins the bet with itself in highly convincing fashion.<br /><br />  No need to get into the details of the plot here. If you were fascinated by the Usual Suspects and the Cube be sure to see this film. It will be right up your alley.
One of the worst movies i have ever seen!  I saw this movie in theaters, and almost walked out.  If I hadnt had payed for the ticket, I would have.  The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen and the script doesnt help at all.  Most of the "scary" parts will just make you laugh, because you do not develop even the slightest connection to any of the characters whatsoever.  The methods of killing are mediocre at best, and, like most horror movies, the intelligence level of the lead characters is very low.  The one redeeming factor of this movie is the ending, which is the only part I enjoyed.  I expeced better.  Thumbs down.
Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot?  This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer.  I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so.  I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.<br /><br />I didn't understand, or care, why any of the characters were acting the way they did; or what was going to happen to them. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something.
The original Saw opens up with an interesting premise. Two guys wake up in a room together...no, it's not that kind of movie! They're both chained to the wall and given a...wait for it, wait for it...SAW! Through the course of the film they have to follow various clues in order to find a way out of the room. There is also a countdown they have to worry about.<br /><br />The writers aren't able to make this premise fully work, and are forced to resort to flashbacks and a side story involving Danny Glover. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. First, because the flashbacks allow us to see Jigsaw's, the mysterious villain, more elaborate traps. Second, because you just can't complain when Murtaugh is on screen.<br /><br />The Jigsaw traps are clever, and involve barbed wire, someone getting burned to death, and a contraption that could potentially tear off someone's jaw. I won't get into too much detail for those of you who haven't seen this movie. I'll save the spoilers for later.<br /><br />There's a lot of nitpicking you could do on the first two-thirds of the film. For example, the flashback are supposed to be told by one character but include things he never would have seen or known about, the camera effects are annoying, and the surviving victim has a really dumb line. I was able to ignore these because it was an interesting premise and had potential. However, I was unable to ignore the last third of the film which had some of the laziest screenwriting I've seen in a while.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler...oh, you get the idea.<br /><br />Cary Elwes gets out of character at the end of the film. For most of the movie he's a calm and collected, but turns on the overacting button at the very end. This isn't all his fault because he has to sell certain actions that make no sense. Early in the film Elwes' character, Dr. Gordon, tells Adam, the other man in the room, to use his shirt to get an object out of reach. At the end of the film Dr. Gordon has to reach a cell phone in order to find out if his family is all right. Instead of following his own advice, he decides to cut off his own leg. I know everybody's been waiting for this the entire film, but does it have to be so contrived. The worst part is that he does take off his shirt, but instead of using it to get the phone he uses it as a tourniquet!<br /><br />One of the big surprises of the film is that the man who we've been lead to believe is Jigsaw is in fact merely being used by Jigsaw. It turns out that Jigsaw has given him a poison and won't give him the antidote unless he follows his instructions. We've seen this character before as an orderly at a hospital. Let me repeat that: he works at a hospital. So, instead of telling one of his coworkers that he's been poisoned, he decides to get involved with an elaborate scheme of kidnapping, and even goes so far as to try and kill someone. I know that if I was presented with those two choices I would definitely go for the latter.<br /><br />The single big surprise the filmmakers graciously leave for the end is the identity of Jigsaw. Jigsaw is actually a cancer patient we see for a total of three seconds during the movie. It also turns out that the dead body is not actually dead, but this same cancer patient who has been sitting there perfectly still for the entire movie. Whoa! You mean to tell me that extra number 37 was Jigsaw this entire time? No way! I should have guessed, it was right in front of me the whole time.<br /><br />I've seen better twist endings from a Scooby-Doo episode. That's not hyperbole either. If you want to see how it should be done check out The Usual Suspects or the original Scream. Those are surprise endings where you don't feel cheated.<br /><br />It's a real shame that the writers came up with such an original idea, but chose to get incredibly lazy for the last third of the movie. If you really want to see a well done horror film that actually uses one set, go check out Cube. The acting isn't better, but the execution is far more interesting.
Beyond a doubt, this is one of the sickest, creepiest, strange, wierd horror/psychological thrillers you will ever see.  I rate it right up there with Takashi Miike's "Audition".  If you like to be scared...I mean really freaked out...this one's for you!
Overall this is a good horror movie. It is one of the most brutal movies easily. However there are some problems.<br /><br />SPOILERS! BEWARE! Read at your own risk.<br /><br />1st off the detectives suffer from stupid cop syndrome. They go to the suspects place and break in without a warrant. I'm no lawyer but I know all evidence they find from that point on is inadmissable in a court of law (rightly so). At that point you want the killer to kill them because these detectives are so stupid.<br /><br />The way the killer toyed with his victims is great, plus as they point out he never actually kills anybody. The ending of where the killer is was great but I do have problems with the actual killers identity. The major flaw of the film is the killer himself. A man dying of an inoperable brain tumor will not have the energy to build elaborate razor wire pits, iron death masks, or just have the strength to overpower their victims every time to capture them. No doubt in the sequel they'll find him in a cancer ward. Making the killer like this took away the believability.<br /><br />Overall this movie is enjoyable to watch and is recommended if you like serial killer movies.
Absolutely fantastic!! I have never seen a movie with a better end. It blowed my mind. Warning some scenes is pretty nasty. You have to see the movie to understand. SEE IT!!
No, please. This is blood in the name of suspense. This has gone really far.<br /><br />Let's see. Is it NECESSARY to spoil a not bad plot with so much blood? I was really interested in what was the reason of such a game. I am giving two stars because the thing is original overall. But the interest is soon forgotten as you take more care in find out if some blood has splitted over you.<br /><br />And this is not the only bad thing. It is very annoying to see Danny Glover in such an awful role. When actors are getting older they must have a decent job. It is simple: look at what "Lethal Weapon" was. Mel Gibson has really improved his roles. Danny Glover has gone worse...<br /><br />Even if you have a well-formed stomach this is no good for you... if you have a well-formed brain.
SAW is a good thriller: a film with a lot of potential, but lacking in follow-through.  On the one hand, the premise is very cool.  Two men wake up in a bathroom, chained to piping, completely unaware of where they are or why.  As the film progresses, these two men start to piece together their situation: they have been planted in this situation by a deranged madman, someone who enjoys placing his victims in life-or-death situations and forcing them to make horrific decisions.  It's a marvelous setup and the surprising conclusion is right on target and thrilling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film reeks of a small budget.  The acting, in particular, is quite poor.  Unlike SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SAW fails to explore its characters.  Instead, the madman's device becomes the center of the entire film and our poor actors get to scream and cry their way through 100 minutes.  Moreover, our madman is portrayed as a deranged person, complete with a secret lair and everything.  Unfortunately, we don't come any closer to understanding him by the end of the film than we did at the start.  He appears to be "teaching" his victims a moral lesson, but what that lesson is in his mind is completely obtuse.  Both SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS also have clever plot devices, deranged madmen, and the like.  But unlike SAW, they decide to spend most of their time revealing their characters instead of merely relying on the plot devices.  The result is a much more engaging, interesting, and ultimately satisfying thriller.  It may seem like a strange thing to say, but exploring the haunted games of a madman is not nearly as creepy as exploring the haunted depths of a madman's mind.<br /><br />In the end, SAW has a really cool plot device on its hand, but lacks the heart and complexity of other thrillers.  It's definitely worth a look and will thrill anyone who loves this genre.  But with mediocre acting and complexity, it will never reach the status of either SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
I went to see this in the theaters the opening weekend on Haloween this past fall. I'd have to say that this movie is false advertising. Haloween movies have always been cheesy and bloody and thats how I like them. I was expecting this kind of urban horror movie with all sorts of nasty violence/blood and a decent plot. Dont get me wrong- I'm not a sick f***, but sometimes thats the kind of movie i wanna see. This was a serious dissapointment. "Saw" tried to pack way too much plot into 100 mins running time, confusing the hell out of me. The ending was absolutely awesome, it makes the experience not so empty and wasted.  If your looking for a gorefest, this aint it. Sure, it got an R in US 18A in Canada, but there's other horror movies at your local store that surpass this easily.If your looking for a movie to make you think, this aint it either. Confusing the viewer doesnt lead to thinking IMO.All in all, not what it tried to be or could have been. I honestly cant recommend this.
ok, this was the first movie i've seen in a wicked long time that actually creeped me out. because it's one of those movies that could easily be real and i wont ruin it for people who havnt seen it yet but i always love movies that end like this one did they just make me feel like going out and robbing a bank hoping i get two cops like the ones in this movie to chase after me but i'd just like to say that i dont like the direction all these new horror movies are going in.it's good that they dont follow that same old formula but where the hell is the nudity. thats a very important part of a horror movie and trust me this movies had plenty of oportunities to show some.really who doesnt like the ocasional comfort of seeing a naked women amidst all the killing
First horror movie after playing the silent hill games to ever leave me a lil bit disturbed even asfter the movie. it has a feel of silent hill ez. 5 stars is just nit enough
The nature of human motivation has usually two different sources that elicit a certain behavior.  These sources are either extrinsic or intrinsic.  Intrinsic motivation stems from within a person while the extrinsic source is influence generated by someone or something else.  Whether the source is external or internal it also presents a further division in needs and desires.  Needs being what a person requires to survive, and desires illustrates what a person wants.  Saw presents situations where human motivation is put to the test in regards to survival and the desire to live.  However, the situation that Saw presents comes at a dreadful price, which will undoubtedly terrorize the audience's own consciousness and perception of human needs and desires.<br /><br />The opening of Saw introduces two characters chained to heavy pipes in an abandoned bathroom at some unknown location where no one can hear them scream.  The room has intense lighting once the lights are turned on, which tosses no shadows of either character. In essence, it is a visual analogy for how their persona will be scrutinized by both parties, as the light will reveal everything.  Quickly one of the men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), questions why they are there because if someone desired them dead it could have been accomplished long ago.<br /><br />When the light is turned on for the first time, Adam (Leigh Whannell), discovered that he is not alone in the room, as between him and Dr. Gordon there is a corpse with a gun in it's hand and a tape recorder in the other.  It seems as if the corpse has blown away part of his own cranium with the gun in his hand.  Under the intense light the two chained men begin to search for ways of escaping, while they begin to discover small clues of what is expected out of them.<br /><br />It seems as if Adam is expected to kill himself, which he finds out through a tape that he finds in his own pocket.  Dr. Gordon discovers a similar tape and a bullet in his pocket that expresses anticipation in regards to Dr. Gordon who is expected to murder his new roommate.  The two men have a little more than six hours to find a solution to their deadly predicament.  During these six hours the audience is drawn into a number of flashbacks that provide information of how they were chosen to participate in this sick game.  It is also revealed that Dr. Gordon is aware of who the person is that has chained them in the unfamiliar room.<br /><br />Through Dr. Gordon it is disclosed that a serial killer that goes by the nickname Jigsaw has taken them hostage and chained them.  The killer himself has never actually killed someone, however, he has planned some truly grotesque schemes that have led to a tormenting death that has delivered pain of inconceivable magnitude.  The great extent to which the Jigsaw killer has planned his bizarre schemes will display a man with enormous amount motivation to seek some form of enlightenment in an outmost horrific manner.<br /><br />Saw dwells in the twilight land as it offers the audience a haunting journey that plunges deep into the darkness of the human psyche where nothing is sacred, as human motivation to live is skewed by an external source.  A mind to generate such horrors illustrates deep insights into psychology and human behavior, but it also displays the eccentricity of a creative mind.  James Wan and Leigh Whannell who created the story together offer a horror tale that evokes nightmares and difficult sleeping patterns in retrospect of the cinematic experience.<br /><br />The film had a good beginning theme, however, after about an hour and ten minutes the film seemed to begin slowly spiral downwards.  Nonetheless, Saw offers a truly ghastly film experience, which is built on good script and good mise-en-scene that helps enhance the terror in the story.  The camera work elevates the film, as it brings moments to the audience that will awaken feelings of revulsion and dismay.  In the end, do not expect a good night sleep, as Saw will haunt the mind for sometime after the end credits have been burnt into the retina of the audience.
"Saw" is an brilliant suspense thriller! It is one of the best suspense thrillers since "Seven" and "The Silence Of The Lambs"! I mean that with personal consideration for the film. It is inventive, well-executed, and, also, well-budgeted, as its production budget cost $1 million to make the movie and it is one of the best-looking movies this year. The story revolves about two men trapped in an old bathroom. Dr. Lawrence Gordon, played by Cary Elwes, is an oncologist. Adam, played by Leigh Whannell, is an photographer. Lawrence figures out that a serial killer named Jigsaw, that was involved with an murder investigation run by Detective David Tapp, played by Danny Glover and his partner, Detective Steven Sing, played by Ken Leung. Jigsaw has, somewhat, kidnapped them, and Lawrence and Adam find out that they are apart of a murderous game that Jigsaw gives to the victims that he kidnaps. Lawrence, also finds out that his wife, Allison, played by Monica Potter, and his daughter, Diana, played by Makenzie Vega, has been kidnapped by the same killer, as well. Lawrence and Adam, find out that Lawrence has to kill Adam by 6:00 p.m., or else, Diana and Allison will die, as well as, Lawrence and Adam. This is one of the best independent films in recent history and of all time. It is better than "The Blair Witch Project". Cary Elwes (who was recently seen on screen this year as Edgar in "Ella Enchanted" (2004) & on tv in "The Riverman" as serial killer Ted Bundy), does an well-executed performance as Lawrence, an man wrought with hard hitting emotion. Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the screenplay and co-wrote the story with its director, James Wan), does an pitch-perfect performance as Adam. Danny Glover (well known as Roger Murtagh in the Lethal Weapon movies) is superb as Tapp. The directing by James Wan is excellent. The story by Wan and Whannell is brilliant and the screenplay by Whannell is brilliant, as well. This is the way that screenplays for suspense thrillers should be written. It is inventive and well thoughtout. The music by Charlie Clouser (a producer for the rock group Nine Inch Nails) is excellent. The casting by Amy Lippens is excellent. The cinematography by David A. Armstrong is brilliant. The film editing by Kevin Greutert is excellent. The costume design by Jennifer L. Soulages is excellent. The production design by Julie Berghoff is brilliant. The art direction by Nanet Harty is brilliant. Go see it if you want to or not. It is a great movie to watch on Halloween. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.
I rented this one to see if it was actually as bad as the premise would suggest.  It was.  Not only did I feel sick while watching this movie, I felt nauseous for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I'm not talking about a squeamish kind of nausea; my stomach is a strong as they come.  I felt disgusted with myself for actually having watched and sat through this dog.<br /><br />Sadly, there was a time in my teens when I would have absolutely loved this flick.<br /><br />PS-- I also felt cheated by the image of a rotary saw blade on the dvd, when all they used were cheap hacksaws... big difference.
great suprise ending, but lacks scares and is sort of boring like in my opinion
This film, which was shot in a scant eighteen days, is stunningly original in concept. I confess that I was totally riveted to the screen for the entire running time of the  film, as was my son. Edgy and somewhat surreal, the film clearly demonstrates that the director, James Wan,  can certainly do more with less, as the film was shot on a shoestring budget. Yet, he also knows that less is sometimes more, as he keeps the actual  amount of on screen gore to a minimum. In doing so, he forces a viewer's imagination to work overtime, which serves to create more suspense than a visual statement of the obvious.<br /><br />The plot is diabolically clever. It appears that a maniac is on the loose, placing people in fiendish situations that are truly matters of life or death, virtually ensuring that someone dies. The deaths occur in a highly unusual manner, indicative of a complex and maniacal mind at work. Detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung) are on the case and hot on this maniac's trail. When on the verge of his capture, however, everything goes wrong, and Detective Tapp becomes somewhat unhinged after a total debacle ensues.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr.  Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), who was himself a suspect in the case, suddenly finds himself in a filthy, ancient, cavernous bathroom, along with a young man  named Adam (Leigh Whannell). Both are chained to pipes in the wall and are disoriented and unsure as to how they got there. Between them and just beyond their reach lies an apparently dead man in a pool of blood, ostensibly killed with the gun that he still holds in his hand. Then, Dr. Gordon and Adam discover that a series of cryptic  instructions have been left for them to follow.  Each instruction clearly delineates just how precarious their position is.<br /><br />What follows is a mesmerizing cat and mouse game, replete with a number of twists and turns, that is sure to keep the viewer enthralled. This is certainly a plot driven, rather than character driven, film. Therefore, although some of the acting is not of the highest caliber, it matters not, as it is the plot, and not the individual characterizations, that are at the central core of this gripping film. Moreover, the plot is so creative and riveting, that some of its flaws become virtually insignificant in the overall scheme of things.  The screenwriter, Leigh Whannell, who also plays the part of Adam, deserves kudos for his complex and clever screenplay. He deserves less than that for his portrayal of Adam. Mr. Whannell should concentrate on screenplay writing, as it is there that his true gift lies. Notwithstanding this relatively minor criticism, I love this film!
Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it.
A pointless plot, bad acting and the typical Hollywood formula for teeny-bopper horror movies. The ending made the movie go from crap to MAJOR crap. This movie is very scary and disturbing - for 3rd graders....<br /><br />You want disturbing?  You want to be freaked out for weeks after a movie?  Try out some of the best, most disturbing work anywhere - look up director Takashi Miike on Amazon, then try out Audition, Gozu, Ichi, etc.<br /><br />But for all those who thought SAW was scary and disturbing, then forget it - you couldn't handle Miike.  Try Sesame Street.
How does anyone say the Saw movies are better than Hostel,these movies don't deliver anywhere near the amoount of carnage that movies like Hostel and Wolf Creek do. These movies are soft enough for elementary kids to watch. The gore doesn't match up to Hostel and the story doesn't match up to Seven. This movie doesn't deliver on either level its suppose to.
This movie works for about 45 minutes, then takes a horrible nose dive with some truly ridiculous plot twists. AND I was SO happy when Danny Glover got massacred in this movie. I actually stood up and clapped. Any detective who has his gun on the killer and doesn't get him, then loses him AGAIN after obsessing over the crime to the point of insanity, deserves to die. This movie was really dumb. Bad writing, bad acting (now we know where has-been actors like Cary Eiwes go to die). What a waste.
I saw this movie with a friend of mine the other night and I have to admit I was really looking forward to it.  I was told that it was a bit gory but it had a good plot and the ending was good as well.  WRONG!!!<br /><br />This movie had poor acting as well as a very dark plot.  There is nothing happy or satisfying in this movie.  In the end, you feel very cheated and wish you had the last 100 minutes of your life back.  If you are looking for a good thriller, do not see saw!
Okay, within the first five minutes of Saw you meet the two main characters who, by the way, are chained in a filthy bathroom.  They soon find that they are part of a sick game of survival hosted by a madman. The object of this game is for one of the men(Elwes) to kill his cellmate(his name escapes me at the moment).  But how, you ask.  Well by a cigarette poisoned with tainted blood.  Creative, huh?<br /><br />The result of this movie is sickening to the viewer and the audience in my theater showed it quite well.  This movie is sure to disgust you with its terrible ending. Oh and the other actor's(not Elwes) acting in the movie is mediocre at best.  His crying scene made many of us in the audience laugh.  Save your money, because the killer escapes anyway.  The movie was obviously short of time within the first draft of the script, because the writers played out even the tiniest storylines.  I'm sorry to all the Saw fans out there, I just don't enjoy movies like this.<br /><br />Sighs<br /><br />R
I had high expectations about this movie.  It's a psychological thriller where the Jigsaw Killer essentially forces his victim's to die or kill the other person in the room with them.<br /><br />This movie was a huge disappointment.  It was not smart, not well acted, not a good plot.  I just didn't find it plausable, especially the ending. I guess you'll have to judge for yourselves, but two feet down for me. The rest of this review contains spoilers.<br /><br />*SPOLIER ALERT*<br /><br />Here are some of my problems<br /><br />1. The guy lying on the floor the whole time and they didn't know he was alive.  Plus he has tape player in one hand, gun in the other, and electruction button where? Sorry not buying it.<br /><br />2. You don't know if Dr. Gordon lives or dies.<br /><br />3.  The guy kills Adam for losing the game.  I didn't know he was playing a game.  What was it?  I thought Dr. Gordon was playing the game.<br /><br />4.  The orderly who is "innocent" and kidnaps the wife and kid decides to hold a stethoscope to their hearts to hear their fear but he's not even the bad guy.  Stupid.<br /><br />5.  The bad guy is terminal and in the hospital but he is perfectly fine when it comes to building the face-ripper-aparter and barb-wire maze.<br /><br />6.  The whole thing about Adam taking pictures of Gordon and that's how they wound up together. Retarded.<br /><br />7. Danny Glover and his parter have the bad guy.  Danny Glover is pointing a shotgun at him, the partner is trying to stop the head-drilling machine.  The partner shoots the drills.  Somehow this distracts Danny Glover and the bad guy gets away.  What the f***?  That's so stupid.  Then the bad guy gets shot in the back with a shotgun then gets up and runs away.  Brother.<br /><br />8. Finally, I just couldn't buy into the fact that Gordon would saw his foot off.  Even at one's most irrational point you have to know it'll take like half an hour to saw through the bone and then you'll bleed to death, and then you don't know where they are so you won't get to them for who knows how long.  Plus, wouldn't you pass out before you could saw your foot all the way off.  Anyway<br /><br />P.S.  I have to credit some of these points to earlier reviews, they're not all mine.
As a rule, the odds of discovering a gem in an increasingly lackluster genre of horror are rather small.  More often than not, these hopefuls turn out to be shallow and laughable (to use an epithet so abhorred by the director of Ju-On on his commentary to the deleted scenes).  It is with great regret that I must inform all those curious souls who discern quality, that "Saw" is pretty much glorified trash.  It was a shock to see Danny Glover take part in this production, and a shame that even in this obscure flick, his part was reduced to the elemental obsessive cop personality.  That, in turn, left much space for the horrendous "Westley" (a memorable role in "The Princess Bride") to deliver most ridiculous lines and, nearing the dubious conclusion, incessant and annoying sobbing .  All in all -- don't bother.  As for some arcane comparisons to "Seven" -- not even close.  The integrity of the cast and the filmmaking in the latter is far beyond "Saw's" range, aside from the fact that "Seven" came out some 10 years ago.  Better luck next time.
Lame. This movie debuts at #1 on the 2004 Craplist. It tries to much to be like "Seven" and "The Usual Suspects" and falls short of even effectively duplicating the plot twists and surprises of those two films. I wanted both my time and money back. I would escape by sawing MY leg off if I was chained to a floor in a dank room and forced to watch this movie over and over again.  And if you didn't pick up on what was going to happen in the first five minutes, like what the title meant, then you're an idiot who provides a market for brainless films with bad acting and sensationalized plots and idiotic violence. I'm sorry, but this movie SUCKED!
This movie was not bad but it wasnet good either it's just there. The acting was really bad and I mean bad it's funny to watch them act becouse you dont believe them at parts and you want to tell them to get acting lessons. The story is ok about two men changed to the wall and they have to saw there arms or legs off to survive. The film has lots of pointless charactors and the film i found draged on at times. The film did have some disterbing and scary moments and the ending was pretty good. Overall it;s worth to watch once but it's not great or good and not as good as people where saying it was.
THERE SIMPLY IS NOT A WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE WITHOUT RUINING THE END OR THE ENTIRE MOVIE FOR THAT MATTER. YUO JUST HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE PERIOD.SAW I MUST SAY WAS THE MOST RECENT HORROR FILM TO LEAVE A LASTING EFFECT IN MY MIND ITS ORIGINAL FOR THE MOST PART SIMILAR STYLES HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE FOR INSATANCE THE FILM SEVEN BUT NOT TO THE SAME DEGREE IN MY OPINION AND THATS ALL THIS IS  MY OPINION. I WILL SAY THIS I DID JUMP AND SQUIRM MANY TIMES WHITCH IS WHAT MAKES A GOOD HORROR RIGHT? OR SHOULD YOU BE SO CONFUSED YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE FILM OVER AND OVER TO GET THE JIST OF THE FILM . I DONT THINK SO THERE IS A LITTLE CONFUSION YOU DO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION AND NOT BE ON YOUR 9TH BEER WHEN WATCHING SAW,ALSO IF POSSIBLE WATCH IT ALONE AND DARKEN THE ROOM.DANNY GLOVER PLAYS A ON THE EDGE AT ONE POINT BURNT OUT DETECTIVE AND HIS PARTNER KEEPS HIM GOING AFTER THE JIGSAW KILLER AND THE OTHER MANY ACTORS MOSTLY PLAY VICTIMS OF THE JIGSAW AND TELL THERE VERSION OF THE KILLINGS AND LET ME TELL YA THE KILLINGS FOR THE MOST PART ARE ORIGINAL AND EXTREME AND GRAPHIC NOT FOR KIDS TO WATCH.I DONT WANNA SPOLIE THE MOVIE BY SAYING TO MUCH BECAUSE IT CAN BE EASILY DONE LIKE I SAID YOU JUST HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM ITS A REAL WINNER IT DOES WORK AND IT WILL BE A CLASSIC IN TIME  ESPECIALLY WITH THE SEQUAL COMING OUT SOON THERE IS BOUND TO BE AN EPIC HERE.  BRIAN
Okay, I had about three girls from my school say "Oh my God, this movie is scarier than the Ring!" I'm terrified of The Ring for some unknown reason (as well as The Grudge but that's another story) so it completely turned me off against seeing it. Then last night, I stayed the night with my friend and she owned it and said "Let's watch it." (Saw, duh). I was a bit antsy but whatever, so I went downstairs with her and we watched it, but before we did she was like "This movie is sooo scary. I mean, more than The Grudge, more than The Ring, more than the Sixth Sense." that right there made me feel MUCH better (note the sarcasm) but as I watched it I was like 'Geez, this isn't even a horror flick, it's a flippin mystery!'. My friend screamed throughout the whole movie and I just stared at it like "Wow. I wonder what's gonna happen next.".<br /><br />Personally, if you're a big horror buff, you might not like this movie all too much. But if you're interesed in shows like CSI, Third Watch, and mystery movies, go ahead and be my guest.
I just bought & watched this movie I received this weekend, was scary, suspense, and great movie, scrip was real good. REALLY FREAKY IN THE END AHHH, U WOULD NEVER THINK THAT... I gives a 5 stars, great ADUIO 6.1 DTS sound, really enjoyed it .BUY IT.  DON'T MISS IT!!!.
I saw "saw" the other noght and I loved it, it starts off just rite, the guys wakes up he's in a room chained up with another guy with a dead body in the room.4.7/5.0
If This Movie Is The One I'm Thinking Off Calling "Saw" Then This Is A Really Freaky Movie NOT FOR THE WEAK STOMACH!! This "Juggsaw Puzzle Killer" Gets His Vitcums And Puts Them In A Situation And You Have Choices If YOu Wanna Live Or Die. He Doesnt Really Kill Anyone, He Finds Ways For His Vitcums To Kill Themselfs. It Has Cary Elwes (The Crush,The Princess Bride)He Becomes One Of The Vitcums And Is Traped In A (What Looks To Be A Big Bathroom) With Another Man Named "Adam" And The Dr.Gordon (Cary Elwes)Has Till 6:00 That Night To Kill Adam Or Dr. Gordon's Wife And Daughter Will Be Killed! Its A Great Movie With A Twisted Ending!!!
This movie is really scary i couldnt sleep through the night becuase of the clown that just creeps me out at the end is corny but its good
SI DUDA ALGUNA ESTA ES LA MEJOR PELICULA DE ESTE TIPO DE GENERO...MUCHO MEJOR QUE SEVEN,RESURRECCION,EL COLECCIONISTA DE HUESOS,ETC<br /><br />LA VERDAD ES QUE EL PUZZLE ES UN PSICOPATA MUCHO MAS RETORCIDO QUE CUALQUIERA DE LOS QUE SALEN EN PELICULAS DE ESTE TIPO;Y MUCHO MAS H... DE P...A.<br /><br />LAS PRUEBAS A LAS QUE PONE A SUS VICTIMAS SON RETORCIDAS Y A CUAL MEJOR.<br /><br />TODA LA PELICULA ES GENIAL.PERO LOS CINCO ULTIMOS MINUTOS SON DE LO MEJORCITO E IMPREVISIBLE QUE TE PUEDAS IMAGINAR,LLENO DE TENSION Y ANGUSTIA Y QUE T DEJARA CON LA BOCA ABIERTA....PERO ESO NO QUIERE DECIR QUE EL RESTO DE PELICULA SEA MALO;NI MUCHO MENOS.<br /><br />A TITULO PERSONAL A MI ME GUSTA MUCHO EL PLANO FINAL CON EL QUE ACABA LA PELICULA.<br /><br />POR CIERTO SAW 2 Y ALGO MAS FLOJA PERO IGUAL DE GENIAL....OS LA RECOMIENDO
I thought this would be scary! It wasn't but that's ok! It was a great movie, though! Obviously it's about this psycho and he has this puppet thingy. This one part a girl is trapped in all this gear and she has to get out of the chair she's trapped in and then her time starts ticking. I think she has one minute. And she has to find the key and it's in this guys stomache so she has to cut him open so u see lots of blood. I did think the puppet was scary!
Saw is a very disturbing movie. I watched it about 10 minuts ago and I am still shaking. It is about two men trapped together in a room, and the only way to stay alive is to kill the other man. There is a complex story line.<br /><br />This movie is confusing at sometimes but overall it is an okay movie. I personaly would never want to watch it again because it is so weird.<br /><br />Saw is very unique. I have never seen a movie like this anywere before.<br /><br />I dont think you should buy this dvd because I dont think you would watch this movie again.It is one of those movies you would be bored watching twice. I would suggest renting it though because it is worth seeing once.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review, I Hope it was helpful.
O.k.<br /><br />I love how hollywood pumps up the hype on all these lame " SO CALLED HORROR FLIMS!" 2 guys in a room for a long time, Wow scary!! GO get SHAUN OF THE DEAD OR BUBBA HO-TEP! those are the only cool FUN movies out in a long time! Oh the new Texas chainsaw re-make was damn cool too.
Saw is really the scariest movie of the year. i personally think it's really smart and original, and the special effects are awesome! But, actually, I do have one complain about it: I think it's very strong, and some scenes it has are very strong and I think they could disturb some people's minds...<br /><br />However, why doesn't it include deleted scenes? I read some time ago that it was censored and some scenes had been cut of the theatrical release, so I thought the DVD would include those scenes, but it doesn't :( That dissapointed me a little
I HAVE ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE AS IT CONTAINS ALL THE SUCCESFULL ELEMENTS TO PRODUCE A HOROR, TWIST IN THE TALE,THRILLER MOVIE.MANY THANKS TO THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER AND LOOKING FORWARD THE SECOND EPISODE...
When you awake it is so dark you can taste it.<br /><br />You swim up through the darkness, struggling fitfully out of sleep, strangling, lungs clotted with the choking darkness, close around you and pressing down on your chest. You struggle out of one nightmare to awake in another: you're not in your own bed. The darkness is total: the stink of death rancid in your nostrils. You're on a cold, wet tile floor, but beyond that you can't see anything, can't find your way in the ink-black dark that covers you. You panic: your breath is fast and ragged, you whimper and cry out.<br /><br />Now: most nightmares are the worst when the lights are out; when the lights come on, you're snug, cuddled beneath the blanket of Normalcy and the Everyday. In "Saw", the nightmare begins when the lights come on.<br /><br />By now, everyone knows the legendary set-up of the deliciously sick piece of celluloid that is "Saw": Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, playing a guy named "Lawrence" if ever there was one) awake chained to pipes across from each other in a filthy industrial utility room. In the middle of this abbatoir lies the corpse of a man, face down in his own blood, a .38 revolver clamped in his dead hand. Their true whereabouts? Unknown. How they came there? Unknown. The someone---or something---that delivered them to such a state?<br /><br />Unknown.<br /><br />"Saw" might pass itself off as a horror movie, but the fact is that this engine of death and destruction is a flick with more on its mind than splatter. This is a film about Crime and Punishment.<br /><br />In our enlightened age, we kill our killers with lethal injection. Think of that: those who kill children and bury them alive, hack the limbs off antique pensioners, those who scar and murder and rape and mutilate and defile---all of them are sent out of this vale of tears in a state of peaceful, drug-addled slumber. Some of you---myself included---would say this is a travesty: even the Death Penalty in our enfeebled land is hardly a true punishment tailored to the brutalities perpetrated by the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Well, then, rejoice in "Saw", for the killer---the man, or Creature, or being, or darksome thing that lurks behind the name and mask of the Jigsaw Killer---feels as we do: he is a believer in Justice. He is a believe in the ultimate Talmudic rite: let the Punishment fit the Crime.<br /><br />Dr. Gordon and Adam find their respective instructions, left on a tape muffled and distorted but wickedly clear: they have eight hours. Eight hours to kill the other man, to cut him down like a dog, to find the key, to escape the deathhouse, this charnel sewer. Eight hours: Fail, and for Adam, it is Death. For Dr. Gordon, it is death---and the death of Family as well (Mackenzie Vega and Monica Potter, both carrying their weight admirably).<br /><br />"Saw" is a brilliant little piece of terror, perfectly economical, remarkably efficient at terrorizing its audience. It is more so for being entirely unpredictable: I found "Saw" to be the cinematic equivalent of drinking Scotch on the porch, outside, on a summer night: lifting the tumbler to your lips, only to find your mouth millimeters away from a fat, bloated, dying Black Widow spider, contorted with her death throes, larger than a piece of ice, floating, seething, dying in your drink.<br /><br />I have never seen a film---outside "The Blair Witch Project"---so dependent on light and dark to evoke a mood. I have never seen a film so entirely capable and competent at conjuring up a mood of isolation, of wicked machination, of brutal death, solely by its use of light and dark. "Saw" immerses you in a charnel house sunk deep within the ground, well stocked with clues---indeed, whatever you think of this monster called the Jigsaw Killer, you must at least acknowledge his willingness to provide his victims with the means to their salvation.<br /><br />Watch "Saw" in the dark, all the lights off, preferably with a storm howling and pounding outside the window. For "Saw" is only slightly a serial killer movie: it tips its hat to "Se7en" and "Silence of the Lambs", but its dark, wicked, brutal art is born from far more truly from the monster movie. "Saw" is about a monster: a creature that crawls, writhes, plots, engineers, from the shadows.<br /><br />Director James Wan has pulled off what, by my lights, is the perfect horror movie: compactly edited, brutally effective, happy to spill blood in the service of its message, consumingly efficient and economic. If there is a scarier device in cinema than a puppet rolled out on a tricycle to gibber in the dark, I have yet to see it. Wan and Director of Photography David Armstrong use dark and light to evoke claustrophobia, fear's aphrodisiac, and spike the mixture with psychedelic images of horror and death.<br /><br />The acting throughout is solid and compelling. Much has been said about Elwes's overracting---but as you watch "Saw", you realize this is a film about surfaces, and the darkness, and lies, and deception that lies beneath. Yes, Dr. Gordon is over the top---and he has a reason to be. Elwes and Whannel carry their roles like champs, right down to the point where those rusty hacksaws become one-way tickets to the bright land of Normalcy. Danny Glover (Detective Tapp)pounds out the most engaging, riveting performance of his career, as a defrocked detective who can't let go.<br /><br />"Saw" is a brutal, seedy, seething charnel-house of death and truth. Yes, yes---"Live or Die, make your Choice"---but if Jim Morrison was right about no one here getting out alive, how much of a choice do we have?<br /><br />JSG
When i got saw, i thought "Finally, a gore fest in a movie!",<br /><br />but there isn't a lot of blood in it. That was a dissapoinment.<br /><br />The story is completley dumb. I thought that the puppet was the killer. But it's some retarted fat bald guy. If you want a gore fest, this will dissapoint. First when you see it, you will want to close your eyes beacuse you dont want to see brutal, gory murders, dont, nothing will happen, it will censor it by going to another scene. Thats just stupid. Rent it.
"Saw" is a pretty turgid affair despite the quick-cut, snappy title sequence a la David Fincher. The great title sequence of "Saw" is about the extent of the creative, adventurous juices on view in this film. And the actual director of this film, James Wan (what an appropriate name!) didn't have anything to do with the title sequence: a company that specializes in title sequences always does this.<br /><br />The plot as concocted by Wan and Leigh Whannel (who also plays Adam) is a cat and mouse contraption with so many inconsistencies that we soon lose interest in trying to figure it out. I mean: two men are chained to drain pipes in an abandoned sewage plant for reasons only their captor can fathom. To top that off there is a dead man on the floor surrounding by a huge pool of blood.<br /><br />The acting is grade school by Whannell (he had to have gotten this part by way of his deal with the studio) and Cary Elwes (remember when he was actually good?). And the big denouement is silly.<br /><br />I saw "Saw" and now I have indigestion.
Firstly Yes the Movie Looked Excellent On the Trailer, But Like Lots Now adays, It the Old saying Great Trailer Bad Flim. The Review say Lots of Blood and Shocking Moments.. But after the First 10 Minutes, the Once Scary Movie turns into a Guy telling a Story about this serial Killers and few murders he did, Which ain't really scary at all...<br /><br />If this Film Class as being shocking Or Blood fill, then I must of fell asleep when i was watching it.Unless you count Blood on the Floor as Gore.. Ok At the End there finally a Moment of Eyes closing when the Saw is Used, But that's 15 Seconds, All you see is a guy with a cloth in His Mouth..Coming to the End, i thought i was watching the usual suspects...........<br /><br />If you want to watch a Thriller, then watch this...if you want to watch REAL HORROR MOVIE...Then WatchClassic *Silence of the Lambs..
I can understand when someone likes a film for reasons others may hate it, and sometimes acting, mood, lighting, sound, and direction all make a huge effect on someone's opinion of something. I believe anything could be better than this 'film', even cutting myself to pieces and filming it would be more fun than this crap!<br /><br />Danny Glover stars in this. I had to check the main Amazon page to verify that sense I don't own this crap. Isn't that a shock in the rubber parts??!! To think at one time he was doing such GREAT work in classics like "The Color Purple" to sink to doing this. Wow, what a downfall!! I think Danny Glover needed the money. I was embarrassed for him! And, I thought he was embarrassing in "Gone Fishin", but this is the bottom of the barrel. This is unwatchable garbage.<br /><br />Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.<br /><br />This isn't 'horror', nor is it a 'film', but disgusting pieces of footage combined together to whet a poor filmmaker's egotistical fetishes and air them in public for all to see; and, what vile carnal garbage this is, at that. Bilge like this should be flushed down the toilet, along with the people who made it. I couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes of this crap. It isn't merely disgusting, it's PRETENTIOUS JUNK that's pretending to be "art", when in reality it has NOTHING to say or add to the world...except maybe provide viewing pleasure for people who get off on watching torture. And THAT'S scary. We've sunk pretty low. These are some sorry individuals who made this!<br /><br />The scariest thing is indeed the fact that so many people love this crap. Some are starting to call it "torture porn", meaning that it's pornography for people who love violence, not sex. I think that's an apt description.<br /><br />These movies are inhuman. People, mostly kids and young adults, are paying good money to enjoy watching inhuman acts. Society is becoming like "Lord of the Flies". And the people who are the sickest are the least likely to see it in themselves, apparently.<br /><br />I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.<br /><br />I read someone reviewing "Hostel part 2" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic "Silence of the Lambs", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and considered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society???<br /><br />If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plumber working, that would be more entertaining than this trash any day.<br /><br />And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there. Thank you.
I'll keep it simple.  This is a trite and contrived attempt and making a thriller.  Basically the entire movie is stolen from previous thrillers like Seven.  The characters are boring and the acting is comically bad.  Danny Glover and the rest of the cast should be ashamed of themselves.  If you're like me you'll be hoping everyone dies at the end.  I love how people we're going on and on about how gross the movie was.  It was so weak. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie.  Save yourself the time and money.
Por ahi lei que esta pelicula seria para esta decada lo que Seven fue para los noventas, y que razon tenian. Es una pelicula cuya trama  nos mantiene inmersos y con la u&ntilde;as clavadas en el sillon. Saw tiene esos momentos fuertes y sangrientos que hacen taparse los ojos a aquellos de voluntad (y estomago) debil. Tiene un guion muy bueno y la direccion y fotografia en general excelentes tambien. Pero cabe destacar que esta pelicula no es para toda la gente ya que contiene violencia (completamente) explicita y escenas algo fuertes. Pero si te gusta el Gore y buscas una pelicula con una buena historia (no como la mayoria de las de tipo B) estilo Seven, Saw definitivamente es para ti.<br /><br />PD. Esta edicion especial es increible, la portada viene en una burbuja con liquido rojo (supuestamente sangre) con una sierra impresa en un plastico por separado que flota dentro de la burbuja. Los subtitulos en espa&ntilde;ol son muy bien recibidos. Es una magnifica adicion para cualquier amante del cine, ya sea o no coleccionista.
When the acting is so hideous that you want EVERYONE to die, it's really hard to find a movie appealing. If you really want a scare, watch Black Christmas. The writers should be ashamed of this trash.
(Spoilers)<br /><br />Oh man, remember that movie Se7en? That was a classic. So good it just cries out for a remake. Only, instead of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, let's see if we can't get Cary Elwes and Danny Glover, both of whom are available for a slice of pie. Also, let's take the taut, inexorable logic of the original and turn it on its head... sorry, DROP it on its head, removing all wit and sense. Throw in a puppet and a dirty bathroom and BAM! You got yourself a half-a**'d movie, my friend!<br /><br />SAW actually starts out promising enough. The director throws you into things in media res with Elwes and Some Dude awakening to their surprise in the aforementioned toilette, chained to some pipes that are probably non-functional, but sufficiently atmospheric in a Godsmack video kind of way. Naturally, questions abound. How did they get here? What diabolical madman would do such a thing? How come there's no toilet paper? You get the idea.<br /><br />Come to find out, Elwes is an oncologist, and these two clowns are at the mercy of one of his cancer patients. That's right, a guy with Stage IV colorectal cancer arranges to capture, kidnap, and torture able-bodied guys half his age. As someone with Stage III colorectal cancer myself, I gotta say, my man gets around!<br /><br />Would you like a run-down of SAW's 700 other plot holes? Or a sneak peek of its preposterous 'surprise' ending? I didn't think so. Suffice it to say that you get a couple of Se7en's elaborate death traps, but you don't get the moral irony behind them. You don't even get a lot of scare or even gore for your dough. Your biggest fear is that the film will never end!<br /><br />Props to the puppet, though.
I purchased this item at a very good price but when I got it , it wasnt what the picture said it was.
This movie is about some crazy guy nicknamed Jigsaw who kidnaps people and tries teach them lifes values, by putting them through sick twisted games.What the heck is that all about?!It is nothing but blood and gore throungh the whole movie! If I could give this movie 0 stars I would,it sucks!
You heard me! This movie sucks. Everything about it is stupid. This film is disgusting. It is polution to your mind to watch this. Stay away.
"Cube" is much scarier and better made, using a similar idea. Find out what happens to six people who wake up trapped in a mysterious white room that seemingly has no doors. Truly frightening!
This movie was OK, it was kind of disturbing, but it was OK, The acting of Cary Lewis, I thought, was pretty bad. I really, really, did not like the ending. Other people who I have talked to said this movie was dumb, and I agree with them. The people who thought this movie was good, you obviously have no good taste in movies and believe me, I know movies, and I know when or when not to recommend them to people and this is one that I would not recommened.
Let's face facts, if you are dying to see this film I won't change your mind. This review is for those on the fence. A lot of the five star reviews talk about the low budget and twist ending so let's address that first. It is VERY apparent that a film has a low budget when the boom microphone is visible in approximately 8 shots in the movie. About five of which are in the opening minutes of the film (pay attention to "Adam" because that black spot above his head is not a film flaw). I saw this in a dollar theater so perhaps they have made enough money to digitally erase it from the DVD (if not those wacky college kids have a new drinking game-"take a shot for every time the boom mic appears"). Those boring hyper-cool quick cut flashy strobe like filming sequences that some of us remember being trite in the prime of MTV's "headbangers ball" days are over used and only make the film that much worse. They become especially ridiculous during a car chase sequence (why not just do a few quick cuts back and forth). The final "twist" ending involving the killer's identity is on some level morally off even to those not easily offended. They should have sat the killer down for a good viewing of "Ikiru". It did surprise me... in the sense that it had no real logic to it. Other than that, the two name actors (Elwes and Glover) phone it in. Probably because they saw the dailies and decided to just collect a pay check (everyone has to eat). The script is like a mix of "Fear Factor" and Donald Kauffman's writing before his untimely demise in "Adaptation". It provided me with many laughs as a whole and Mike (as the boom mic came to be known after sooo many appearences) made for a good running joke. However, in my meager two cents worth of opinion the people that are hailing this as genius are the same people that make movies like "Final Destination 2" commercial successes.
do not waste your time or money on this juvenile,lame-a** plot,piece of trash. if i was about,say..13,14, i'd say "cool man,that was gory",not caring about plot. but i'm 30yrs past that. i do love blood&guts so....but GD, there HAS TO BE A STORY LINE. anybody who liked this should think the"faces of death" tapes are the ultimate. put this one straight in the roundfile.
la verdad que esto es un insulto para las personas...una pelicula...por demas sangrienta....con un argumento...terrible...pesimas actuaciones....realmente..hubiera preferido .. no verla<br /><br />salduos
Saw begins with two men in room chained in a room with a dead body.  Tapes detailing a "Game" are in their pockets describing what is required to escape.  The premise of this movie sounded similar to other movies I have seen.  That's where it stops.  This movie is an adrenaline pumping, graphic and shocking take on the Suspense/Horror/Thriller Combo.  This movie had me locked in from beginning to end.  This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen.  The realistic visuals take you further into the story adding a depth to it that I can't even recall having seen before.  The cast does a wonderful job with this story and each one brought their character vividly to life.  The lines between reality and fiction are crossed in the style of movie it is and how it was shot I felt my pulse pounding and as if I were there with the characters.  Not just sitting in a seat watching the movie but actually biting my nails.  This is what they mean when they say "EDGE OF YOUR SEAT".  Be warned this movie is graphically violent.  I don't just mean normal horror movie violent I mean scare you to death violent.  I saw this movie and began telling all my family and friends to see it.<br /><br />If you are in the least bit squeemish DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />This is the one time what they describe is absolutely delivered.  This movie was horrifying and even now I know I won't be able to sleep for thinking about it.  It's disturbing and yet I couldn't keep from watching.<br /><br />I have no idea who made the movie, but I know I'll remember the movie for years to come.
This movie is a classic horror movie because it has a lot of blood, suspense, sick and nasty stuff.<br />But it is so creative too because dang, all the clues that have been showed throughout the movie have something to do with the KILLER, yet, it is hard to find out who is him. At the end of the movie, every single clue comes alive and We understand everything, which is why this has creativity, it is simple, the acting is great IMO, DR. Gordon is one of the best actors.<br />This is one of my top favorites for sure along with the A nightmare on Elm Street Series, and The Omen Series.
4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />With the glut of the so called "torture porn" genre over the last ten years, & myself being 52 years old & weaned on monster/ghost movies, I just didn't have the time nor desire to watch "Saw." A movie that is majorly responsible for this masochistic horror sub-genre, that's really is only an excuse to see people graphically tortured & mutilated, without any redeeming qualities. I was WRONG!<br /><br />I had just got Netflix streaming & there was "Saw." I thought to myself, why not, lets see what all the hoopla is about. I mean a film that is pretty much responsible for a whole horror sub-genre, has to have something going for it, right? Right! I was very pleasantly surprised! Here we have a film with a white knuckled terrific plot, what would you do to save yourself? Great acting, an intelligent script, great pacing & direction, & it was more than just a torture porn flick, it had redeeming qualities & characters. It was not what I expected at all! It was actually closer to films like "Silence of the Lambs" & "Seven, & was the best film of that ilk since those great movies! I was almost dumbfounded, & thought, why did I wait so long!<br /><br />"Saw" is a movie that every horror & non-horror fan should see. It is a shining example of how to get much mileage out of a film, with no gas money. Though I'm not inspired to check out it's sequels, as most sequels get progressively worse, this is a film I'll watch many more times, & recommend!<br /><br />A cutting edge film!
Up to this point, I had avoided watching any of the Saw movies. I'm a definite fan of horror movies, but a gore fest is not my idea of entertainment. I just ignored the hype over the whole series because of the basic premise, until now. The plot is nothing special, nor is the acting, but I have to say I enjoyed it. It wasn't overly bloody like I figured it would be and there was enough plot twists and suspense that kept me captivated. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish, but for all the horror fans out there, its worth the money to rent.
SAW is the most interesting movie ive ever had the honor to view. Though the acting is not the greatest,the overall theme and various messeges of the movie make it all worth while. In order to enjoy it,you have to try to get inside the jigsaw killer's twisted mind. He is not a killer. He tests his victims to see what they will do to stay alive (to prove the value of life). There is an art to the jigsaw killers actions...almost poetic.<br /><br />This film goes to show that evenwith a dirt-low production value, a great film can be made.
I'm a fan of SAW. Not really scary to me but gross and bloody. Those are the best kind of horror movies. Great suspense too. Definitely a must have. I already have a copy of SAW but I purchased one from Amazon as a gift. Love the price.
I remember seeing this movie at my local movie rental store and wanting to check it out, but never got around to actually watching it for the longest time. What was I waiting for?! "Saw" is the first of this amazing franchise in horror and it's a goody. It's fresh, smart and keeps you guessing. With a unique storyline complete with twists, surprises, puzzles and intense horror, "Saw" is movie that keeps you watching. As the story unfolds, you won't believe how the people are so linked together; having more in common then you can know. And you especially won't believe the ending! It is truly epic. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell did a great job with this film.<br /><br />In a downright disgusting bathroom, Adam (Leigh Whannell), a voyeur photographer, wakes up in a bathtub with his foot chained to a pipe. Across from him, foot also chained to a pipe is Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), a doctor. In the middle of the room lies the body of a man, a gun clutched in one hand and a tape player in the other. Adam and Lawrence each find a tape in their pocket and upon playing them, are met with the creepy recorded voice giving them the staggering situation: Lawrence must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife (Monica Potter) and daughter (Makenzie Vega) will die and Adam will either watch himself die or do something about it. The voice is that of the "Jigsaw Killer," a psychopath who kidnaps people he feels are ungrateful and undeserving of their lives and hurls them into the thralls of bloody, mind-numbing, torturous, life-threatening games of traps, where they must find new appreciation for their lives by facing death. Adam and Lawrence are the newest pawns in Jigsaw's twisted charade, and clues to their "game" are around the bathroom.<br /><br />We first learn about Jigsaw through Lawrence's recollections of three other grisly "games" that were conducted. There's Paul, the suicidal man who comes face to face with razor wire. There's Mark, a man notorious for faking illness who finds himself covered in a flammable substance and needing a candle to help find a safe combination. Then there's Amanda, the drug addict who wakes up with a reverse bear trap hooked up to her head and jaws. To unlock it, she needs the key from inside the stomach of her dead cellmate. There is also one other Jigsaw trap that happens later on in the movie involving a man named Jeff. Jeff is sitting in a chair, his neck braced in place. A button is stepped on, which activates two drills coming at Jeff; one on each side of his head. According to Jigsaw, he is giving Jeff's life a purpose.<br /><br />But "Saw" also focuses around the detectives investigating the Jigsaw murders; detectives Steven Sing (Ken Leung) and detective David Tapp (Danny Glover). We see flashbacks of Tapp and Sing investigating Jigsaw traps, interviewing a possible suspect and talking with a Jigsaw survivor. Both are very committed to the Jigsaw case but Tapp becomes obsessed with it after an unfortunate incident. This obsession will ultimately lead him to someone else who is just as obsessed and desperate, but also dangerous.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, the intensity heightens as time ticks away for Adam and Lawrence. I've seen some reviews saying that the acting is either bad, or just "okay." I for one, actually liked the acting, especially from Cary Elwes as the drama builds. I thought he did a great job displaying the intense pain, desperation, anger and feeling of helplessness. I really got into the emotion he brings to the film. And you can feel the psychological madness within him as he prepares to make and conducts some dramatic decisions. Leigh Whannell brings a little levity to the movie as Adam. His sarcastic wit brings some choice phrases to the film amongst the horror. He has a calmness, yet you feel his helplessness as well. Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega aren't bad for acting either as they are held hostage in their home. And then there's Danny Glover, playing a pivotal role as the obsessed former detective. He does a great job with some thrilling scenes in the film.<br /><br />"Saw" is a great horror movie will leave you questioning things every minute. Though not as gory as the other Saw movies, I still wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart. The special effects are pretty good for a low-budget film. It's intense, disturbing and horrific; the way a good horror movie should be. Horror fans won't be disappointed. If you haven't seen "Saw" yet, you're missing out. Get involved in this awesomely sick and twisted horror franchise and start with the movie that began the saga.
The first time I watched SAW I loved it. All I had seen before were trailers on television for all the sequels which just looked like a bunch of people stuck in not very well thought out traps that were just there to cause as much bloodshed as possible. So, I loved the whole concept of SAW and its portrayal of people as the selfish egocentric people we are. We will do whatever it takes to survive sometimes causing others pain and even death(just think of all the looting and gangs with guns that populated New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina).<br /><br />That being said, when I watched SAW for the second time I found about half of the acting to be really pretty bad. Anytime Lawrence(Cary Elwes) was trying to act sad and almost crying I found it very unbelievable. Also a lot of Adam's(Leigh Whannell lines came off a little awkwardly but that is just my opinion.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed SAW, especially its concept, but some parts were dragged down by the poor acting.
What a difference one film can make that would eventually spawn a popular and successful franchise known as 'Saw'. The myster built behind the Jigsaw murders was awesome. The film led you to believe who the killer was as the film went on until a huge twist hits you at the end. The ending will always be remembered and the film overall is a gem. Definitly a recommendation to any movie watcher of any genre.
Its been a long time since a good mystery movie came out. The characters were interesting and made you think. The ending will always be remembered as a huge twist that no one saw coming.
This movie looks totally stupid.  I agree with the other reviewers, this is just a lame wannabe version of SEVEN.  It tries and wants so hard to be "arty" or "crazy" that it just isn't.  Silence of the Lambs was better.  For a Halloween movie, Nightmare before Christmas is still much better.  This is like a lame, ridiculous stereotype of the genre.  Boo, indeed.  Just another attempt to squeeze money out of a Holiday while putting no real feeling into a film.
At first I really enjoyed this movie but the last half was okay and the ending was so excrucitaingly awful I fealt like I wasted an hour and a half just for a stupid ending like that.
This film was stupid. What a let down. Looked very good in the trailers. Saw sucked!!!!!
THis is one of those movies that does not play it fair. What this kind of movie does? It's simple. It catches you attention by means of a clever and intelligent first act, then goes to unlimited plot twists and clever editing that makes your brain gets numb and you will feel that you are watching a great movie, that you are being entertained. Then, some minutes after the movie ends you suddenly ask yourself: "What the heck...?" The next affirmative is: "This is the new champion of plot holes". Then comes the sad conclusion: "What an awful movie! How could I be fooled this way?!" And then you will wnat your money back, but it's too late.
Wow, movies today are getting more repulsive and disgusting by the minute. No wonder we have so much teenage violence. This movie goes way too far as far as blood and gore goes. I mean, we dont need to watch some guy sawing his leg off and getting shot in the head. Directors are just trying anything they can to get a rise out of people these days, its pathetic. Save your money.
(big time spoiler) This is one of those movies that you hear everybody calling it the best horror movie in the long time, but actually suck. This is one of those Blair Witch Project movies that you wait 1  or 2 hours for something to happen but at the end the whole movie goes down the drain. A guy cuts his arm off (and doesn't bleed to death). A very young girl is gagged and the camera insists on her cries and suffering (which is so wrong), and at the end the killer gets away (who by the way didn't have any reasons to do what he did). This movie is so DUMB I couldn't believe my eyes. If you are a horror fan like me, try: Hellraiser (all of them) the entire Nightmare on Elm Street collection, Jaws (1&2), the original Exorcist, the original The Fog, The Ring (1&2) and the Scream trilogy - stay away from SAW; or watch it to see how bad it sucks
SAW 2 IS COMING OUT.. IT'S CALLED<br /><br />SAW 2 : SAWIN' LOGS (THIS YEARS FALL A-SLEEPER HIT)<br /><br />SAW WAS LAME.. COME ON.. I AM A HORROR FAN & I THOUGHT THIS WAS LAME.. THE ACTING WAS STRAIGHT FROM HELL.. AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MOVIE WAS A "BEEN THERE, DONE THAT" SCENE.. THIS FILM WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS "THE VILLAGE" OWWWW WAS THAT ONE BAD! AND I WATCHED BOTH THESE FLOPS ON THE SAME NIGHT! HELL, IT WAS I TELL YOU! MY EYES ARE STILL BLEEDING!<br /><br />SAW ME IN HALF IF I HAVE TO SEE THIS ONE AGAIN!
Cary Elwes doesnt even deserve to be making films - this movie was just terrible and I could not believe how bad the acting was.  The concept was good and in better hands - it couldve been an okay film - but in this case a laughable farce that shouldve gone straight to video.  Definitely deserves to be in a list for the top 10 worst films - it would almost be the top of my list.
The movie starts out kinda good (first 1/2 hour). Gets lost in the middle with Danny Glover running around for no reason. His character in the movie seemed pointless and reminded me in a small way of Glover in Predator 2 (sweaty and bloody, but not in as good of shape). Anyway, the acting was horrible (Cary was the WORST) and the ending was VERY predictable. If you bought this before DO NOT buy it again! If you didn't buy the first release do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this one either. Severed thumbs way down!!!
This movie is horrible.<br /><br />Its not even worth 1 star.<br /><br />This plot is so overused, I mean if you like this at least watch Seven you might view Saw differently, I could tell a couple college kids wrote it in 2 weeks its a simple formula for money which is a big part what the movie industry is about, but comon now.<br /><br />But I am going to give it a star, not as a horror movie but a comedic attempt at a horror movie, some of the scenes are friggin hillarious in retrospect, recommended for a good laugh.
u offered the saw blood cover with pics and all of it said u had it than sent the one with reg cover dont like the way your company does biz.
this film is doesn't make sense, so it starts where two guys are locked up, it's doesn't build up at all, there already there at the beginning. I like certain things to build up, not cut to chase that soon, but I don't like certain things to build up too long, it's got to be just right. terrible ending, worse than "War of the Worlds"  Ed Wood probably made better thrillers than this bloodbath crap. how does movie even in a genre, it's not horror nor suspense, it's bloodbath crap. Cary Elwes what happened to great lines like "hey great gift dad"
I didn't hear anything about the Saw Series, until the 1st installment was released on DVD. I rented it, loved it so much that I bought it and never looked back. I went to the theatre to see the later releases each year.<br /><br />Saw I is a different twist to the horror genre. The killer isn't actually the killer.
Saw brings life into the Horror movie genre. Saw is either my first or second favorite horror movie of all time.(competing with the Halloween franchise)<br />Saw is a very entertaing yet very disturbing movie. Unpredictable to the very end. I could not beleive the ending! It defently makes me want to run to the movie store and rent Saw 2!<br /><br />Another thing that makes "Saw" a fantastic movie is the music. Whenever the "Saw Theme" would play, my heart would speed up.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Horror movies you will love this film !
I haven't seen this movie since it's release, but it's Halloween and I decided to do a Saw marathon. This movie is perhaps the best in the series. It has a lot of mystery and suspense. I think not knowing who Jigsaw is adds to the enjoyment. The later installments peeled the mystery away from him and it hurt the overall feel of the franchise. This movie does not have a lot of traps, they are not as elaborate as the traps in the sequel, but they are nicely used. There are so many twists and turns in this movie it's hard to even guess the next turn. I personally like Danny Glover and he does a great job. He should have been a more central character. The entire movie your trying to figure out who jigsaw is and that adds to the movie's greatness. As the series progressed the mystery element was taken away piece by piece. There are a lot of characters interacting around this "game" and that adds to the overall feel of desperation of this movie. This movie is a classic. The rest in the series decide to stand on gore instead of real suspense. This is a classic worth treasuring.
I love the Saw series, and I noticed that this was a really great price on the UMD format of the film.  Overall I am satisfied with the product and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an intense, gruesome movie experience with a shocking ending!
This is where the games began, and started an entire franchise of Saw films. Before there was Hoffman, Strahm, Jill, and Erickson, it was just Jigsaw testing Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon in an old dirty and filthy bathroom with a dead body in the middle. They hear a tape by Jigsaw that tells Dr. Gordon to kill Adam by 6:00 a.m., or his wife and daughter will die. Zep has his family hostage and Detecive David Tapp still thinks that Dr. Gordon is linked to the Jigsaw murders. Throughout the time in the room, we see flashbacks of Jigsaw's other games, and why Adam and Gordon are in the room. If you love horror, and twists, you'll love SAW!!!
This was a great performence, shocking, thrilling, touture, enjoyment i really enjoyed it. I liked all the saws but part3 was not that good but theothers were, so this was a great movie.
Typical horror movies seek to use startle horror or just throw intense amounts of gore to scare.<br /><br />Saw has some of both but by far blows away any other attempts to categorize this film. Unique movies are becoming very difficult to find but this movie will leave you wanting more and with a pleasantly disturbing feeling in the pit of your stomach that I haven't felt since such awesome films as Seven and Frailty.
Horror films are definitely a mixed bag when it comes to quality. There are some horror films that are really good, meaning they have a solid story, genuine thrills, and leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Examples of good horror films are "Final Destination", the `Scream' trilogy, and the classic "Halloween". But for every really solid effort in the horror genre there are about 10 terrible entries that give the genre a bad name, most of these inferior entries consist of sequels to average or above average horror movies that are made for nothing more than cashing in on the original film's success and hopefully making a little money before fading quickly from the public's memory. In 2004, amidst a crop of forgettable horror releases, one horror movie caught audiences completely by surprise with its in-your-face brand of terror that hadn't been seen in most horror films, with a surprisingly strong story that was full of twists and turns that would make any mystery fan happy, and a fairly solid cast of actors that didn't consist of fresh-faced teenagers that barely have any acting experience. The movie I'm referring to was the smash hit "Saw" from director James Wan ("Death Sentence"), and starring Danny Glover (`Lethal Weapon' series), Cary Elwes ("Robin Hood: Men in Tights"), and Monica Potter ("Along Came a Spider").<br /><br />"Saw" focuses on a deranged serial killer who feels that it is his mission in life to teach those who take life for granted a lesson by capturing them and forcing them to choose between fighting for their lives by surviving horrifying circumstances or giving up and dying. His latest victims are a successful doctor (Cary Elwes) and a young photographer (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay). These two unwitting participants in the killer's twisted game must try to work together to solve the mystery of why they are being held captive, while determining the means of their escape from certain death. Meanwhile, a former detective (Danny Glover) is trying to put the pieces together regarding the last case he was working when he left the force, which unbeknownst to him is directly linked to the two captives who may soon become the latest victims of this methodical killer, with a simple message of, "Live or die, make your choice."<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I was a little mixed in my opinion of. The first time I watched "Saw" I didn't really care for it all that much, I thought that it was a better than average entry into the horror genre, but was trying too hard to cross genres with being a horror film and also a thriller in the vein of "Se7en". But after watching "Saw" for a second time, I feel it was a much better horror movie than I initially believed it to be, and was also an adequate mystery thriller that set itself apart from most horror films by actually having a decent story and not relying on some supernatural killer, that for some unknown reason audiences are intrigued by, to propel the movie forward. In fact, you barely even see the killer in this movie, which is even more surprising for a horror film these days, having a modern horror film that actually leaves its killer shrouded in mystery is unheard of, and was very much appreciated here.<br /><br />Now, some of you may be wondering where I came up with the comparison of "Saw" and "Se7en", well here it is. Both movies feature villains who feel it is their sole purpose in life to teach others a lesson about what they've done wrong in their lives. Both villains are patient, smart, and incredibly deranged in their view of the world, and feel completely justified in the pain they inflict upon their victims. I also feel that director James Wan was aware of this comparison, and purposely paid homage to "Se7en" with the use of the exact same type of notebooks that were used by the killer in the movie "Se7en" spread all over Danny Glover's apartment in this movie. With all the various types of notebooks out there why choose that same exact one, unless you were meaning for people to recognize it, and therefore draw comparisons. Now, James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell may not have intended for there to be as much comparison between the two films as I have seen, but the similarities are there all the same. With all that being said, I don't feel that "Saw" as a film, suffers from its similarity to "Se7en" (granted its not as strong of a mystery thriller as the latter, but it's adequate), the two films are different enough in their execution (no pun intended) that the similarity is nothing more than an obvious influence for their story.<br /><br />The actors were of a much higher caliber than one normally expects from horror films these days. Generally the cast of horror films consists of some of the newest actors Hollywood has to offer, and generally will focus heavily on talk of sex and feature plenty of nudity from its attractive leading ladies, thus ensuring plenty of teenagers (especially guys) will give the movie a generous box office return and maybe even repeat business. But, "Saw" went a different route by casting veteran actors such as Danny Glover and Cary Elwes, along with the not as well known Monica Potter to bring their characters to life. Most of the cast were very effective in their roles, even screenwriter Leigh Whannell as the other man trapped with Cary Elwes, was surprisingly good as an actor. But the weakest link in the acting chain was Cary Elwes. For an actor who has been around as long as he has, it's kind of a surprise that he's never managed to elevate his craft from anything more than that of an average actor who has a tendency to overact in his dramatic parts, but excels when it comes to comedy which is probably why "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" and "The Princess Bride" are the two biggest movies of his career. The decision to give Cary top-billing for this movie seemed odd, since he's not that big of a name, and from a talent perspective, I figured they would have given that honor to Danny Glover, but I'm not the one making those decisions.<br /><br />One more thing regarding this movie that also further set it apart from most movies of this genre is the lack of blood and gore that was actually seen in the film. Most horror films opt for putting as much blood and gore on the screen as they possibly can, leaving nothing to the imagination, and frankly most audiences are numb to it at this point. But "Saw" went with the approach of implied gore; yes, there were moments of bloodshed on the screen but not much more than what is shown in an all-out action movie. Although the blood and gore were implied, the film still delivers on the horror, by forcing the audience to envision in their heads what could have taken place onscreen. However, in place of actual blood and gore, the director and writer included plenty of disturbing traps and images, along with creepy music and quick, frantic editing, that gave the audience the impression that the film was much more violent and gory than it actually was which may cause some viewers to dislike the film due to an implied sense of an overabundance of gratuitous graphic violence.<br /><br />"Saw" is without a doubt a very creepy horror film that delivers plenty of chills, but also gives audiences a solid story that will keep them guessing what will happen next. A word to parents, this is one horror film that's rating should definitely be heeded, as I don't feel that viewers under the age of 17 should see this movie without parental approval.<br /><br />"Saw" is available in both rated R and unrated editions both contain violence and language.
I heard this was a good film through some friends and considering it was the week of halloween I thought celebrate with a good scary movie. I don't really care for movies that have a gotcha or someones going to getcha theme. This really played into the mind I figured out almost right away who the guy was but I really liked it any way. In fact the point of the movie is to make you appreciate your life. I got out of it what I needed a little scared but not grossed out by blood.
This movie was deliberately shot in a grainy style.  It is not the fault of Blu-ray.  The movie does not look excellent, but it does look very good.  It is difficult to judge a movie with such a different style of filming...kind of like 300.  Either you think it is Extraordinary, or bad...all due to the filming.  I would expect Saw 4 to look the same when it comes out in the fall.
This was not as gory as I had been led to expect. The twists ARE NOT as predictable as most people think. No.. you don't really see the ending coming.<br />This is a psychological thriller and it's very good. Well done. There were discrepancies like someone having flash backs to someone else's memories. And some people acting pretty much annoying and the excuses for acting out of the very character templates are rather weak. A cop stays a cop. And if he's watching someone leave a building, he should have noticed when someone went in - or more specifically that he missed it when they went in and had an alarm go off in his head.<br />Characters are engines to further a plot but they need to be more or you end up with GhostShip where frankly you don't even bother remembering anyone's name - you already know their parts and purposes.<br /><br />I will definately get the next one. This movie was such a pleasant surprise!
"Saw" is by far the best of the 3 "Saw" movies. It has suspense, was very unpredictable, and had creative murder sequences. They should have stopped with this one though because Saw II and Saw III are horrible.
The previews you see for the Saw during commercial breaks on the television are misleading because Saw is *not* a typical "maniac with a saw comes out of the closet and attacks helpless horny teens" horror.  This is truly a disturbing film about a smart and dangerous killer who gives two people (who are chained to the floor of a bathroom) certain strategies that need to be completed in order to succeed at the killers twisted little game.  It's unreal.<br /><br />Every time the two guys think they found a way to get out of the situation, they quickly find out that the killer already found a way to trick them.  The killer is always one step ahead of them.<br /><br />You will find out that the weapon of choice, the saw, is to be used in a deeply disturbing (and cleverly written) way.  Throughout the movie, the killer plays these sick little games with the two guys trapped in the bathroom, and it's truly something that will disturb anyone because it shows you exactly what the sickest kind of people on earth can be capable of.<br /><br />I was truly surprised that this movie was a more creative kind of horror than what the previews seem to show us.  Watch it.  It's an interesting and nicely created horror film.
saw is definently a good movie that keeps you thinking. the ending completely threw me off, big time. if you've never seen the movie, you will constantly keep guessing but never figure it out. it's almost impossible. this movie was constructed beautifuly.<br /><br />the gore scenes aren't that intense....but the plot and everything else makes up for it. by all means there is gore, but it's not unbearable. the acting was good, plot was good, ending threw me off. not a scary movie, but a sick, intense, brilliant movie that will keep you thinking the whole way through.<br /><br />i am about to watch saw II and then saw III, and i am very excited to do so, i know i'm kind of late on watching the first 2, i wish i would've watched them a long time ago.<br /><br />i would definently recommend these films.<br /><br />4 stars. brilliant. not for the weak at heart.
SAW is a deliciously psychotic crime thriller that keeps you guessing till the very end.  The production values are high and the acting is competantly well above the vast majority of similar creepshows. Decent amount of Grand Guignol for us gore-hounds of the world (please don't write to tell me which flicks are more gross as I already know and own most of them).<br /><br />I did not give this movie five stars for a small variety of reasons; the screenplay could have been tweaked a bit,  and certain characters are not really developed to fullest effect.  But I really enjoyed this movie:  I don't want to get picky.<br /><br />I do not view this as a "horror" movie in the classic sense,  but SAW should make you uncomfortable in the extreme.  Avoid the psychedelics for this one,  you crazy kids.<br /><br />As a mystery,  it's great.  A good mystery must very carefully hide the true answers,  all the while dropping sufficient clues to allow the viewer to slove the puzzle.  Saw succeeds perfectly and the misdirection is inspiring.  I felt as if I had been led around like a mouse in a maze of nightmares.  Usually I figure these things out but this one fooled me more than twice.<br /><br />So,  see this film and enjoy.  Try not to read any spoilers;  SAW is best seen with as little info in advance as possible.  If you want to see something really funny,  watch it with someone squeamish.<br /><br />I know people who walked out of the theater and won't get the video.  That's amusing to me because SAW made me H U N G R Y !!
I wasn't expecting this film to be much of anything, but upon viewing I was blown away! Right up til' the end with the twist... WOW! I'd definitely give it 5 stars and see it again. Well acted, timed and scripted.... A great thriller in every sense of the word!
What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  First of all, it is a breath of fresh air, having THE BEST TWIST I have ever seen in any movie EVER!  It is definately a gory 'whodunnit,' as mentioned in other reviews.  The death/gore scenes are sickly brilliant!  I am yet to see 2, but this one is very hard to top.  The last thing I'd do is give away the ending, so if you are into horror movies at all, buy this immediately!  Best horror movie ever made if you ask me.
When you see it you will know what I am  talking about, the goriest part was just absolutely pointless.<br /><br />So other than than it was a mildly entertaining movie.<br /><br />One of the main problems I had with this movie is not setting up danny glover's character, this was just stupid in my opinion.<br /><br />Also the guy running the game was also kind of stupid when you learn all that is going on.  i think the movie would be better if they left some things untold and better involvement for the smaller characters would have helped.<br /><br />Overall gore when they didn't need it, a lot of wholes, and the fact that I never got that tension feeling I was looking for from the 2 main character.<br /><br />Other than that, it was pretty entertaining, rent it don't buy it.
When I sat down to watch this I had no idea what it was about. And it does not take long to find out. We start off with two men chain to opposite sides of a very grimy and disgusting large bathroom. In between them is the body of a man that shot himself in the head. The corpse has a gun in one hand and a tape player in the other. Everything just out of the two men's reach. And then the game begins; they each find an envelope in their pocket with tapes in them. And all they have is a hacksaw each that would never cut through the chains they wear.<br /><br />Then we watch as the story unfolds. The two victims figure out that an ingenious serial killer known as the jigsaw killer placed them there. This plot was well thought out. And the killer has left them no choice. They have to get out our pay the consequences.<br /><br />I do not know what those other reviewers are talking about. This is the first movie in a long time that I did not figure out who the killer was until they let us know. And I was surprised. This movie is worth watching. See if you can figure out who the killer is.
Saw is not the kind of movie which will make you wanna shut your eyes,grab the arm of the person sitting with you,make you jump from your couch and the other things one expects from a movie that is believed to be of much horror and brutality. I saw it last night and I think it is well almost worth the hype owing to the things that you have to explain to yourself rather than let the movie do it for you.<br /><br />The most possible reason for my curiousity for this movie is the amount of ridicule and disappointment people feel for Saw2. This movie was never released in my city but I had to wait and get a dvd from somewhere. It is a 100 minute film and just when your brain starts wondering what is going to happen next it hits with you two or three shocker moments. I must add that the music in the film adds to the tension and strange feeling of admirable awe it arose in me.<br /><br />WHO IS THIS MOVIE FOR?<br /><br />I wouldnt say this movie is for everyone because I am pretty sure a lot of people would find a few flaws and try to explain them to one another. Most people have a "we want to hate a movie" syndrome so it is defintiely not for those looking to ridicule. What really matters is the unique storyline and the sickness behind a brain that wants to teach you a lesson by playing with your life.<br /><br />WHAT WAS WEAK ABOUT THE FILM?<br /><br />The scenes involving the doctor cheating on his wife and the very poor enactment of a fight by the wife just before the doctor is leaving. Also the scene where he is on the laptop trying to look strangely passionate about his work. The detectives were silly too. However, that is about it cause there's a whole lot of WHOA inducing scenes in this suggestive epic of sorts.
I was so shocked and absorbed the first time I saw this film. It was really good. I actually jumped at a few times. I wish I saw this in theaters instead of The Grudge (Not really good). The characters and story were really good all the way through the spellbinding ending. The actors are great in their roles especially Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, and newcomer Leigh Whannell (he also wrote the screenplay). Saw is a tour de force and gives a new edge on a thriller. Highly Recommended.
The movie is not based on people cutting off their limbs with a saw like everyone thinks.  There is only one subtle saw/limb scene.  The acting between the two guys in the bathroom was pretty cheesy, but other than that, I liked it so much I watched it twice!  I haven't seen a good psychological movie like this since The Silence of the Lambs!!
This film is a creepfest on par with Silence of the Lambs.  The writers [and killer] burrow into your mind.  How do you outwit a serial killer who has eluded the police for years and who has never actually killed anyone himself?  How far do you trust someone that you just met when his death could mean your freedom?  What are you truly capable of if your loved ones are in danger?  The more that you learn of the protagonists' predicament and the pure evil of their tormentor the more your skin crawls.  You'll be looking over your shoulder in dark parking garages after this movie.
"Saw" is movie about a serial "killer", who doesnt actually kill his victims himself, he finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Which is actually a pretty interesting idea, and this movie had tons of potential. But its bogged down by marginal acting and holes in the plot. I really cant elaborate on the holes in the plot because it would give away the ending, but in the end you really dont get any resolution or closure. This is a decent movie to just sit around and watch with your friends, but dont expect anything oscar worthy.
The DVD disc of SAW has a round saw on the label.<br />  Kidnapped and instantly a victim, similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305238065">Cube</a> (1998), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDVY">Cube 2 - Hypercube</a>(2002), Adam (Leigh Whannell) had just gone to bed. When he awakens, he finds himself submerged into a water-filled bathtub.  He gets out and finds another man, Lawerence (Cary Elwes, Twister [1996]) also in this unclean bathroom.  Lawerence is chained to a pipe too.  A third man has been killed and is lying on the floor.  The men don't remember how they got there.  They discover each has an envelope in their pocket with their name on it.  Inside the envelope is a mini-tape labeled "play me", a bullet and a small key.<br />  They manage to get the tape recorder away from the dead man.  The message for Adam is, "Are you going to watch yourself die, Adam, or do something about it".  Lawrence's message is that he must kill Adam by 6:00am or his wife and child will die and he will be left to rot in this bathroom.<br />  This industrial bathroom contains many more clues for the men.  The small key does not unlock the chains their foot is trapped in, so they must find a way to survive this thing before 6:00am.  They must also find an "X" that marks the spot.<br />  Cast also includes: Tobin Bell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UW7V">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Full Screen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> [2001]), Dina Meyer, Benito Martinez ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JVUHY">Million Dollar Baby (Full Screen Edition)</a> [2004]), Shawnee Smith (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5RM">The Blob</a> [1988]) and Makenzie Vega.<br />  DVD includes a 2 1/2 minute featurette of the making of SAW.

Very early stages.
The reason why I gave it three stars rather than two is because the plot is actually quite interesting and unique. With a plot this good you would have thought better actors, and better writers would have endeavored in this project. Also I think the film would have been better if their were more shot locations rather than one room. The flashbacks didn't really do much for the film other than tell a brief biography of each main character. It's weird, i don't know which one was the main character really, presumably the doctor was.  With the exception of Danny Glover, who had a lousy part anyways, the acting was very poor indeed, really amateur and contrived as hell. But again to my surprise the bad acting, for some weird reason , makes the movie more believable. It was as if these characters totally improvised their mannerisms and speech, etc. I kinda liked it in the sense that it had a certain freedom to it, and even the bad acting wasn't that annoying. Ok, to be honest this was an amateurish film but it had its moments i thought. You should watch this once but I wouldn't watch it again, it's not one of those movies where u can do that and still enjoy it.
Grand Guignol!  This low budget horror flick falls into that category - stories that are meant to horrify audiences.  And it succeeds, on many levels.  Written by Director James Wan and actor (in this film) Leigh Whannell, SAW drags us into the darkened sewer where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) are chained to opposite sides of a filthy room, the centerpiece of which is a corpse recently dead by gunshot suicide.  Yet on this corpse is a tape recorder and after some otherworldly instructions, each man finds a tape on his person that gives instructions on how to take up the next hour and a half of grisly fantasy.<br /><br />It seems there are loonies out there whose sick minds seek retribution for being ignored or abused by the characters trapped in the sewer lounge.  Included in this m&eacute;lange are Dr. Gordon's wife (Monica Potter) and his daughter, medical and patient personnel from Gordon's oncology practice, and two detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) exploring a serial killer bent on have victims kill themselves in bizarrely medieval methods.  It now seems the good doctor and Adam are the latest players in the sicko's trail and how all this works out is a cat and mouse chase and pulse-pounding (?thudding) run to the finish.  No, giving away the ending would weaken the effect of the story, so leave that alone.  Just be ready to accept the fact that much is left unresolved, making it VERY obvious that we re in for SAW 2 sometime this year.<br /><br />If you love SEVEN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL, and other grisly shows, you'll love this little movie.  Despite its numerous flaws it does succeed in keeping you puzzled enough to overlook the bad acting.  And that is all you can ask from this genre!  Grady Harp, February 2005
If your expecting somthing like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", your gonna be dissapointed, this movie is more like "Seven" but the dialogue of script isn't that great, it starts off good but then you find yourself waiting for it to get good which doesn't happen untill the very end.
This movie should have been better.  There are some good ideas here but, as a whole, the movie doesn't quite hold together.  It never feels quite sure of itself.  Saw is creepy now and then, when it's not beating you over the head with its creepiness.  It makes the movie Seven (a much better movie) seem downright wholesome, taking grimey ambiance to new lows.<br /><br />Where this film really fails is in communicating any sense of real urgency or in creating any sustained tension.  These failings are noticable immediately when we see how quickly our two "protagonists" adapt to their grim circumstance.  The climax falls completely flat with events unfolding in such a way as to diminish the tension rather than build it.<br /><br />All things considered, this thriller is better than most coming out these days.  It is inventive and is generally entertaining.  There are even some genuininely scary moments.  Give this one a rent.
I've managed to miss this one over the last four years. Doesn't deserve four stars in my view. For a film that was obviously made on a reletively low budget it mostly works well though.<br /><br />The story reminded me of the sort of thing Clive Barker might have written in his Books of Blood (a series of short stories). OK there are a few inconsistencies in the plot but I thought it was pretty well acted and the twist at the end is well done. There are some genuinely creepy, not to mention grisly, moments scattered throughout the film.<br /><br />However do not be mislead by the hype and the advertising blurb. This isn't a touch on 'Seven', which is better written, acted and in a totally different class. I have watched 'Seven' many many times, but having just finished watching 'Saw' I really have no desire to see it again.
I am absolutely NOT a fan of the horror genre - on more than one Halloween outing with friends I have run, sobbing, out of a haunted house; my brother gets a kick out of jumping out from behind things to hear me scream; and at night, I still jump into bed from 3 feet away...just in case something's under there. Yet Saw has made it onto the list of my all-time favorite films.<br /><br />Saw's psychological "damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't" concept intrigued me, so I rented it on DVD one night. I shut and locked my bedroom door, turned on every light in the room, and barricaded myself with blankets to see if the product lived up to the hype...and it did.<br /><br />On one hand, I was terrified (afterward, I watched TV for a while to ward off the nightmares)...but I was awed by the film's brilliance. Solid acting, creative cinematography, and the most disturbing and mind-blowing plot twists imaginable.<br /><br />I was so impressed, I saw each sequel on its opening day...from the seat in the rear corner of the theater. No one can sneak up on you from there.
This movie is absolutely pure genius! Not your typical slasher/horror flick. There's plenty of blood and gore, but that's not what carries the movie. The killer is brilliant and creative. It left me guessing who did it all the way to the very end, and then it will leave you with your mouth hanging open in amazement. Very satisfying suspense movie.
RE UNCUT VERSION:  Nothing noticeably different from the original release.  The extras aren't really worth much, except for the cast interviews regarding the doll.  The cover, however, is really cool, a great novelty with the red oil "blood" and water and floating saw blade.  Just one question... why the round saw blade when the type of saw used in the movie is a hacksaw??? Still fun to shake it back and forth and make it look like you are sawing the hand... no need to comment on the movie, it speaks for itself in regards to originality and scare factor...
WOW. I saw this film when it was released in theaters on Halloween of 2004. It had my attention from the opening scene where newcomer actor/writer Leigh Whannell is in the filthy bathroom with "The Princess Bride"'s Cary Elwes. Both are chained by the ankle and in a believable state of confusion. The ingenuity of the Jigsaw "serial" killer is remarkable. This is a man that teaches the morally wayward people that he kidnaps to appreciate the value of their own lifes by testing their survival of the fittest instinct. The film has wit and humor as well. The most memorable line for me was Leigh Whannell's "This is the most fun I've had without lubricant." (referring to being chained and trapped in the bathroom with Jigsaw watching on the video camera). The gruesome scenes are rather intense, so those that have weak stomachs, watch out. Otherwise, grab a bowl of popcorn, cuddle with a blanket and a boyfriend (or girlfriend), and let the games begin!
This is not a film for the faint-hearted nor for Best Oscar for Acting critics. Filmed in a blueish tint, SAW opens with Dr. Larry Gordon (Elwes) and young Adam (Whannell) waking up in a smelly, dirty, grimly room. Each are handcuffed by the ankle to pipes, and when the lights turn on, a dead, bloody body separates the two. They each discover a tape, that when played, explains why there are there. Jigsaw, a crazed "killer", has confined them to this room for their individual failures to appreciate living. Jigsaw puts Dr. Gordon and Larry, like several others, in a situation that they must kill in order to survive. While bloody, the film is also a psychological thriller as it examines the human need to survive, and what ethical boundaries one will cross in order to do so. Reminiscent of Battle Royale, the movie is filled with twists and turns until the final scene. Danny Glover and Monica Potter have secondary roles. While gruesome and enjoyable, the movie as a whole is hampered by a few suspect editing moments and a sub-par director. While Elwes has a history of solid roles, Whannell is fairly amateurish in his acting and Wan's directing only exacerbates the situation. Ignore these details, don't think about the twists, and you'll have a grand, if bloody, ol' time.
"Saw" wants to be "Se7en" with more blood and gore.  It doesn't succeed on any level, but is a decent horror/thriller.  The plot is intriguing and disturbing, as two men are locked in a dirty, closed room where the only escape is by killing the other.  The Jigsaw Killer is never as scary as he should be and the quickly explained twist is a little disappointing, but looking past plot holes and the rip-offs, "Saw" delivers some good scenes of scares and holds up as a decent horror flick, despite Cary Elwe's god-awful acting.
There has been an abundance of reviewers and critics who have said that this movie was bad.  I on the other hand thought that Saw had a great plot and a very stunning end.  I wouldn't give it a full 5 stars because of the very very end.  This movie is very entertaining though and will keep you riveted the entire time.
In this bone chilling, nerve wracking, and nail biting thriller, two men awake in a disgusting and rotting public bathroom unaware of why they are there. Togehter they must piece together all the little clues that are left fo tem in order to find out who is doing this and why. This movie brings a new name to horror, and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout! However, the violence does get extremely brutal/graphic, so i would suggest you watch at your own risk. One last thing, this movie is CHOCK full of eerie seetings, and disturbing plot twists that will wring your stomach raw until you feel as though you might throw up.
