I bought this for my husband for christmas. It is a great dvd and so is all the other fast furious movies. Had no problem with the dvd it work great.
We love the Fast Five series and glad we could complete our collection thanks to Amazon.com!!  The quality is great!
It wasn't the best movie we've seen, but it had plenty of action and we did enjoy watching it. The movie was entertaining even though you might say some of the action was a little far fetched.
The movie itself is great. I'm a big fan of Fast and Furious movies... For this item (both theatrical and extended versions), I noticed that at one part of the movie (where Dom & Bryan are having conversation that they will do the final job and disappear forever), the film stopped at the part of Dom's line "...forever" with no sound and continued again.:-(( I watched this in the big screen and didn't notice that.
When the very first line uttered is internally inconsistent and utter nonsense it gives you a good idea what you're in for. The things people will see this for are well done, physics defying action pieces but there's never any real suspense because the whole thing is completely predictable - like a really expensive Roadrunner cartoon.<br /><br />I heard that Dwayne Johnson put on thirty pounds of muscle for this role. I'm not sure why. The role doesn't require it. My guess is that he wanted to make sure he looked like a credible opponent for his fight with Vin Diesel, but he ended up looking like he could snap Vin in half without trying so the fight lost credibility anyway.
It is another one and I like them all, they are what they say fast and always lots of action.
I would definitely recommend this movie, it is AWESOME! My family loves it! So please go out and get yourself a copy.
Movie came as advertised and in a timely fashion, would purchase from seller again. Great movie, definately recommend seeing it and buying it, Fast and Furious movies just keep upping the ante.
If you like the other "fast and furious" flicks this one won't dissapoint. Start to finish it has action and edge of your seat suspense. Some of the old characters are back with some new alliances so spend the money and enjoy!
This is a great movie really holds your interest and I know we will watch it over again and it will be great to add to our collection
AWESOME!! AWESOME!! FANTASTIC!! GREAT!! lol the best movie in the franchise besides the first one. Can't wait for the 6th one.
An amazing action movie with great drama and for the price you cant beat it.  This is a must buy, watch the movie to the end past the credits you want believe it
Quality and price and delivery was very satisfactory. I would definately order another product from Amazon. The price was excellent.  Cheaper then the stores and i didn't have to go out in the craziness.
es injusto que una pel&iacute;cula tan interesante y deseada por todos, No este a la venta en espa&ntilde;ol me hubiese gustado comprarla poro solo esta en ingles
My husband and I both liked it. Pretty good movie with lots of action. I got it for a good price on Amazon.
This was the best movie of this series. Brought back all the original characters to wrap it up. Best car chase ever! Would recommend this purchase.
Amazon is definitely the place to buy Blu Rays! I got this movie because I got my wife a home theater system for Christmas, and the effects are amazing! It's a great buy. I saw this movie at the cinema, so i knew the story already; but it is nice to be able to pause the movie when you want to refill our popcorn. I was also happy to find out that I could download the digital copy to my wife's iPad so we could watch this movie when go on our trip to Vegas.
This was such a great movie.  My husband and I really enjoyed it and I am sure it will be one we watch often.
this is a super great movie. fast,action packed. there was never a dull or slow moment in this movie. truly a 5 star movie. no question about it.
on time,quick,packaged nice.reasonable,cheap shipping,great condition,made it a perfected gift for the holidays,merry christmas,awsome movie,great quality video,nothing better the blu ray
Fast Five is the best of the series - so far! Action packed & lots of emotion. Definitely a winner!
Great product at an excellent buy. The product was exactly as described with all the different avenues of viewing. For all these car fans it's a great fast paced movie that helps to capitalize on the fast and furious past of the original movies.
This completes his set of all the Fast and Furious films.  He loves the series and was delighted to get the latest one so quickly.  It's a guy movie with fast cars, fast action, insane driving, and all the rest.
This product is amazing!!! My daughters and my son love it.they see it over and over again and they also see the behind the scenes!! This product has very good quality ! We all love it!!!
I had actually gone to the movies and viewed the movie there.  The movie seemed a little long at the time and I knew I did not catch everything... That is why I purchased it!  Overall great movie!
This movie was a good purchase and arrived at it's destination quickly.  Thank you for making it available at an affordable price.
I love action movies, thought the cast was great, saw it at the show and now have the DVD that I will watch more than once.
I really enjoyed this movie.<br />Great story line.  Lots of action.<br />Definitely recommend this movie.<br />I could watch this movie a million time without getting tried of it.<br />Movie came fast in the mail.<br />I would definitely do business again with this seller.
Excellent movie fast paced and worth the watch!  This movie is great for car lovers!  This movie is great for all ages,

love this movie! bought it for my husband who has every other fast and furious movie. this one by far is the best one of them all, definately a must when buying for anyone who loves these movies!
Ordered this DVD after seeing the movie and was pleased with the shipping and quality of dvd and helps complete my set of the fast & Furious series
I am very content with my order, it shipped incredibly fast and was in a solid and durable box for protection from being smashed in the mail. I would definitely rate my experience with this company a five star!
Shipped fast and would order again from this site.  Always have had good luck with Amazon.  Loved Fast and Furious Series.
i had no troubles with the dvd and i recieved it very fast. I would definitely order from this person again
What to say, other than excellent? This is by far the best part of Fast series...by my opinion. Good quality, fast shipping.
I grew up with these movies, from the first to the fifth. I own them all!! Purchased this cheaper online than what i could get in store. The movie is just great! As technology got better so did the movies that were made, and boy this was one of the great ones! I seen this in the theatre and just had to by the DVD.
Fun, stupid low-brow movie. Like The Onion joked, this could have been written by a five year old, but it had hot women and cool cars, and stupid-fun chases. Not bad.
I love this movie dwayne johnson vin diesel and Paul waker ohh my. Action packed and entertaining, even if u didn't really care for the other 4 watch this one ill be glad u did. *spoiler* the screen at the end when the safe is empty that's the best.. great addition to our movie collection highly recommend!!
FAST FIVE is a great action film with less than an "R" rating.  The ending and the extra clip contained within the credits at the end hint at a sixth F&F.  To see how they work both the timeline to explain Han's "death" in Tokyo Drift and the storyline to explain Letty's "death" in #4 would be interesting.  That they do all of this with a high level of action and intensity, but keep the elements contained to less than an "R" rating is nothing short of phenomenal.
Fast Five is as good, if not better, than the 4th installment. The actions sequences are fantastic.The story was very well thought out and written with some class
I believe this is my favorite of all the Fast & Furious Movies.  A lot of action and of coarse humor with some drama.  It's definately a movie you can watch over and over again!  It's a must have for the Fast & Furious Fan!
I've reviewed this entire series again and give Fast Five a nod for the action, story and for bringing The Rock and original cast members along for the ride. scratch that, along for the story. The real difference between the series and Fast Five is less fast cars and racing and more plot storyline. I especially liked the truck. I don't know what make it is but it alone is worthy of credit(s). Not a stale scene, great action, well acted and gets you anxious for May 2013 to see TFATF6 keeping The Rock and adding Jason Statham.
It is surely the best of all F&F series!!!<br />Action is awesome!!! Very creative Director - the train and the vault chase, WOW!<br />Very entertaining.  I already watch it twice and I will watch again and again.
Great movie for adults and teenagers. Sometimes sequels are not as good as the original but this was for sure! Some of the scenes are pretty unbelievable, but this was expected with this type of movie.
This was the best of the Fast & Furious series. It bridges the gap between the "Fast & Furious" installment & "Tokyo Drift" installment. Great action & acting in this one. I'm hoping that they'll make another one that picks up after Tokyo Drift. Overall a great movie!
Fast Five is easily the best of the F&TF series, bringing back almost the entire original cast with an all new storyline, featuring our anti-heroes Paul Walker, Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster as wanted criminals in the middle of Central America, and Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and the rest of his crew seeking them out. What makes this movie different from all the others is that the cars are actually NOT the stars of the film. No, this one puts the characters in the forefront, and does so with enough heart-pumping action to keep you invigorated throughout the entire film, including it's teaser ending that feature a cameo by an actress from the 2nd F&F movie, not to mention also hinting at another sequel in a cute and creative way.<br />Everything from the films fast-paced action, brilliant editing, and ear-blasting sound mix make for one of the better action movies to be released in the last 5 to 10 years (sadly, the gun-toting action guy-movie genre has been in very minimal demand due to a stupid influx of cheesy redundant romantic comedies, recycled CGI kids movies and hippie stoner flicks that continuously have been released in the last decade). With a little more of an edge, Fast Five could have easily hit an R-rating, therefore making this one at the borderline PG-13 area, similar to The Dark Knight.<br />The great part about characterization is that, unlike the first film, the two can't really be compared, thus leaving this one completely independent in and of itself, and some of the action is so intense and well choreographed, with completely minimal use of CGI (thank God!) so everything simply feels more real and intense, despite that lots of it is pretty far-fetched. But just like those old exciting 80's and 90's guy flicks, we don't watch them for their realism.<br /><br />What's an extra added bonus is that with this package we get the theatrical and extended edition (granted the extended is only about 1 minute longer), and a digital copy where you can also put the extra bonus features as well as the feature presentation.<br /><br />That said, this one's highly recommended, easily.
Fast Five: may very well be the best of the series. Fast 5 brings together cast members from all of the films with the addition of the Dwayne Johnson. This is an action film at it's finest, with stunts that far exceed it's other films. This is a must own for fans of the franchise or for any action junkie. The film is nonstop explosive fun. I highly recommend this film to anyone.
Order process was easy and quick for this item! I have been waiting for this movie to come out since I saw it in the theaters.  It came earlier that the delivery date they stated.  Have watched it several time- great movie!!
*I am a fan of this type of movie.  I've seen all of the Fast & Furious flicks.  This is the best one so far.  Dwayne Johnson adds a new dimension.  He plays well against the other characters.<br />If you like lots of action, gun fights, car crashes and stunts, then this is your movie
very good story throughout the entire movie. no slow downs or breaks, consistent all the way thru. not a boring second at all. 2 thumbs up
Loved the first one (The Fast and the Furious), skipped 2 and 3 because, well Vin Diesel wasn't in them........... got #4 (Fast and Furious) so I couldn't pass this one up!! The gangs all here, well most of them anyway (with a little teaser at the end) and Dwayne Johnson is added to the mix. This is just a fun, action adventure move. Don't expect anything to much but it's the same caliber as the first and 4th title. Crazy ridiculous, impossible car stunts, chases, fights, hot guys, hot girls and cool cars!! Enjoy!! Oh, and I don't recommend getting behind the wheel of a car for at least an hour after watching this movie, for some reason, people tend to drive faster after watching. ;)
10Bucks is a really good price for this movie. I recommend purchasing now, unless you can find it cheaper elsewhere online (google it). I wish I wouldve known it was $10 on Amazon, then I wouldnt have wasted $19.95 on it at Columbiahouse(dot)com.
this was a good movie you should watch it !!! i bought it at a good price.hope they make another movie like this
The best of all 5 - hope there are more - Of course there will be at least 1 more
great flick.  purchase was as expected.  this was probably the best of all the fast follow up movies, it took no brains to watch and had the stunts expected.
I had not seen any of the "Fast and Furious" movies, but pre-ordered this one on Amazon.com when I saw that two of my favorite actors were in it:  Vin Diesel & "The Rock".  They could have done without some of the scenes, though, such as the "gay bar" stuff.  I really enjoyed the action...fast & furious! :)
Great action movie at a greatprice at amazon.com Have purchased other titles also great deal. thanks for the great offers and avaiblity.
Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film.  Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.<br /><br />Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.  Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of "Desperado" fame.  The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.<br /><br />What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film.  Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts.  Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow.  Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.<br /><br />Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise.  The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil.  International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious "Danza Kuduro" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico.  Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.<br /><br />There are two elements of the film that stand out.  The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs.  The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.<br /><br />The other element is the final car chase of the film.  Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving.  The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.<br /><br />That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course.  To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption.  While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up averageacting at best.  I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much.  While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them.  Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.<br /><br />Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene.  But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.<br /><br />Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours.  While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.<br /><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.  If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series.  Definitely give this one a rent, or get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo to own one of the better movies in the series.
This is the best one of the series so far. I can't wait to see the next one! Keep it up!
The color and the sound is just like being in the movies only your in your own home to see this.
Movie was great......action junkies will love it...(reminds me of bad boys 2...the action sequences anyway)<br />buy it stop reading it...enjoy! Oh it looks and sounds good too
no complaints....the movie is amazing.  the quality is great.  you wont be disappointed.  also has some great features if you have your blu ray player internet ready so make sure to check that out as well!
what can i say, it's vin diesel, a great movie. the best visual effects, i have ever seen. great  great!!!
Im fan of these movies so what I think is that this one is the best of all of them I really like it so thats why I recomended this is the kind of movies that you don't get boreing
For the money the blue ray DVD combo is awesome. And it really is a great movie I enjoyed it
I couldn't wait for this movie to come out on blue ray/dvd. I saw it in the theatre and loved it. A fantastic follow-up movie in the Fast and Furious series. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson fits in perfectly.<br /><br />If you're a fan of these movies, this truly is a must have!!
It was a decent movie. Not sure if all the hype had me expecting more. For the most part, it's an action packed flick with some cool rides. Liked the twists and turns in the storyline and the ending after the credits. Can't wait to see what happens next.
Michael Bay could learn a few tricks from Justin Lin who directs his 3rd franchise hit.  Lin brings back Vin Diesel as Dom who is clearly in charge of the operation once set free from a prison transport bus in the dynamite opening sequence.  Most of the usual crew is back including Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster.  They and a few others end up in Rio.  Once there, needing money, they hook up with a local crime mob to heist a few high end cars.  This sets up another remarkable stunt sequence that is as exciting as those usually reserved for James Bond movies.  Before I get too gushy about the movie, let's get one thing clear.  It is implausible, improbable, and perhaps even impossible.  The acting isn't all that great, the plot is stupid and the science behind some of the stunt work ain't there.  Yet, after being drawn in during the first 20 minutes, you're hooked. You will also see some of the best stunt driving ever.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Park your brain and settle in for the ride.  This is the best of the "Furious" films...by a long shot.
Great movie and be sure to watch the race between Dom and Brian when the credits roll, there's an interesting clip right after it.
the best of the series so far, a must have for any vin diesel fan. The rock in awesome in this one also.
Fast Five (to me) is absolutely the best of the Fast and the Furious movies. And with The Rock in this one makes it ten times better. The fight scene is probably the best.
My son loves all of the Fast and Furious Movies and I got this one for his Birthday. He and my dad both watched it a few times already. Great movie.
The best of the series...I don't buy DVDs very often but I knew I had to have it......I LOVE IT!!!
This version of the Fast and Furious was by far one of the best in the series!  Tons of action and excitement, along with loads of heart pounding burnouts.<br /><br />I enjoyed the interactive features along with the ability to load onto my iPad to watch the video on the road.  The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital combo was worked perfectly and I have already watched the movie at least 4 times from start to finish.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to complete the series.  You will not be disappointed with the fast cars and fast actions of Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, and Paul Walker!  When you finish watching the movie you will be looking to add some NOS to your AMC Gremlin or Pacer!  Imagine a fish bowl with NOS - Sweet!
this was absolutly the best best besst of the series!!!!!! there was so much action n this i wanted to cry. and the ending jst blew my mind open. jst wooww!!!!! cant wait 2 c how they gonna top that n fast 6.
This 5th installment brought all favorite characters from the first 4 together, so it's definitely a treat for all of us that liked the first four. The flavor is in the spirit of the original movie - deeper with more emotions for the characters.  Make sure you see the movie to the end even after the credit. There is a teaser, hinting this 5th movie is not the final!  "Do you believe in ghost?"<br /><br />I'm reviewing just the blu-ray disc. The 1080p video quality is top notch. Detailed, sharp, but look real and natural.  The 5.1 audio is precisely decoded to play on designated speakers in such a way that I felt so involved: rockets whiz pass me, bullets riddled all through me in a cross fire, and car crashes / wrecks are just right level of sound force. I have a Butt Kicker installed under my home theater sofa. When the body slammed into the ground, I get the jolt. When the vault gets dragged on the road, I felt my sofa was getting dragged and me along with it! This is definitely a show piece!<br /><br />There are some nice extras on the blu-ray. The digital copy is also as good as it can be, but I only watched couple of minutes of it.
One of the better of the F&F series, but it's like watching Ocean's Eleven (2001) on steroids. Plenty of action, but more shoot 'em up than the rest of the series. I guess you got to have lots of shooting with "The Rock" in a movie. Probably in his contract. Anyhow it's fast and bloody, so it will be a big hit. Look forward to the next one, since the ending shows a tease about who comes back from the dead next time.<br /><br />Nothing else to say that already hasn't been said. Good movie, but not fantastic.
You have to love the Vin Deisel and Paul Walker combo.  Add in the rock and now your cooking.  This installment has twist and turns you wont see coming and the action is amazing all the way through.  This one has all past cast members and you must keep watching to the very very end!  This was an amazing Action packed Movie the whole family is sure to love.<br /><br />Wendy Moore
When I bought this movie I was not expecting it to be so good. This is by far the best in the series so far. The car scenes are amazing the story itself was more than what I expected from this franchise. The fighting was excellent, whoever thought to match Vin with the Rock was brilliant, could not have seen him fighting it out with anybody else. The on-screen chemistry between the cast is noticable, their passion to deliver the story in the best way possible is evident. Overall 10 of 10 stars
This is a great movie. Just like the rest of the Fast and Furious Movies it's filled with lots of ACTION. I LOVE IT!!
When I saw this movie at the movies, I couldn't wait until it came out on DVD soi mthat I could watch whenever I want to.  My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in new and excellent condition. I would definitely transact business with this seller again.
all i can say it surpasses the previous sequels, great plot, great action, great cast, and a twist ending. fast and furious fans check this excellent well made movie out you'll love it!!
LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!  If there was a way to give it 100 stars I would... thank you so much received it quick and in great condition.  Best movie I have seen in a while!!!!
the movie was well do with alot of special effect,it folowed well with the other movies but it was that little bit better,would definitely suggest this movie to be seen grade a movie
I really liked this sequel even more than the original and the other sequels so far because the scenery in Brazil and the music were so amazing. Also, I loved to see The Rock and Vin Diesel doing the action scenes together, BUT I felt they got a little too carried away with breaking walls in the fight scene.<br />The cars and the driving were great, of course; and then the little teaser at the end was a welcomed surprise. Looking forward to the next sequel. :)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OYKI1I">Fast Five (Extended Version)</a> is a great action move and a great compromise for my husband and I to watch together 'cause there's also a good love story in it, too.
Fast five starring paul walker, and vin diesel is the 5th sequel to fast and furious in which its masterpiece leaves you craving for the next one, that probably will not be out for at least a year. This movie in my opinion must have had a really good screen writer. because there were a lot of parts where the movie could have fallen off the grid to ruin this action packed blockbuster but it always took a turn into making "fast five an instant hit to a fast five star rating!" All the actors and actresses worked well together in a plot that made sense and flowed nicely into action scene after action scene! I even joked about with my wife that they would somehow bring michelle rodriquez back from the dead but now they are planning to in the next movie! WOW! This hollywood cinematic feature scored big time leaving fans waiting to spend their money on the 6th fast and furious movie thrill ride!.....to be continued<br /><br />Godbless<br />~shauns moview review
Title says it all - Fast Five is an incredibly fun and exciting movie. So many great chase scenes and witty back-and-forth between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. If you're a fan of the series - this will be your favorite yet. If not - this will be one of your favorite action movies. The movie was very well done, and there's a nice little surprise at the very end of the credits (at least there was in theaters!)
I've just received ma item 2day 10-06-11 & the estimated delivery date was 10-08-11, therefore you know that this seller is very reliable & prompt on deliverance :) Now that I have all 5 in the series, I cannot quote that it's the "only" best 1 cause I love drifting so I'd say "Fast & the furious:Tokyo drift" & "Fast5" are both the best in the series :)
I am a big Fast and Furious fan as well as a fan of Dwayne Johnson. I put that out there first so as to make you aware of my bias. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I did not get to see it in the theatre so watching it on Blu-Ray was my first viewing of this. Parts that stand out and it is noted in one of the Extras, they try and succeed in establishing a deeper family aspect with the crew. That and fantastic action scenes does not leave the watcher of this bored at all.<br /><br />BLU-RAY QUALITY: 4.5 STARS - Seen better but it was on par with the other movies and a good viewing.<br /><br />STORY: 4.5 STARS - I like how they brought everyone back together and the story was alright. It definitely followed the franchise.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS AND ORIGINAL ACTION: 5 STARS - The opening train heist scene was fantastic and the end Vault chase was amazing.<br /><br />BLU-RAY EXTRAS: 4 STARS - I enjoyed the extras. Little insights to different parts of the movie. Good actor interviews. Good interactions with the director and extra behind the scenes cast. I have not watched the Director Commentary or the Theatrical Version. The Extended Version was good but no idea how much "extra" was included.<br /><br />THE ROCK: 4.5 STARS - I have to rate the Rock individually because I am a fan. This character was a bit out of place and The Rock's performance adds to that. I did like his portrayal of his character.<br /><br />OVERALL FEELING: I rate this 5 stars because as I stated, I like the Fast and Furious franchise and this was my favorite so far. Really I rate this 4.5 stars but with no .5 in Amazon I push to 5 stars as I will watch this again and likely watch the director commentary.
They did it again with this one. The movie was great, just what you would expect from the series. They go a little more over the top with some of the things the cars can do in this film, but who cares. If you wanted to see a realistic movie about driving cars or grand theft auto then you knew before you saw this film that it wasn't for you. I highly recommend this film and can honeslty say that if you truely enjoyed any of the others you will enjoy this one too. The Blu Ray picture is amazing and well worth the extra money.
This is a great movie if you enjoy the series. Adrenaline fueled action from start to finish with some story to garnish the plate. Personally I feel that this is the best movie in the series. These guys are my favorite bad guys by far, and Johnson is an excellent addition to the Fast and Furious family.
It's been a long time since the Jason Bourne Triology that I could be so fascinated by an action movie. The beautiful scenes of Rio, the ultra charming cast (all men and women look like catwalk models), the not too stupid storyline and most importantly the superb though much exaggerated car chases add up to the most entertaining of all 20+ movies I saw this year. Really looking forward to Fast 6 as hinted by the ending scene. In short, a must watch for all action movie fans!
Looking to burn some rubber?  If so, FAST FIVE -- a briskly entertaining action picture that evokes memories of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT PART 3 -- is right up your alley!
** PLOT SYNOPSIS (MINUS ENDING)**<br /><br />Vin Diesel is busted out of prison and is reunited with his sister Jordana Brewster (who I fell in love with in D.E.B.S.) and her bf Paul Walker in Rio, the most recognized skyline in the world. They are bad guys stealing cars off a train. As things turned out, these were cars seized by the Brazilian DEA, who for some reason unlike their American counterparts don't disable the vehicles. Due to infighting, the effort is partially botched and Vin Diesel and Walker end up as captives of a Rio mobster. They discover he wants one of the cars back real bad. After they escape they dismantle the car to find out way.<br /><br />Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson comes down from the US to take back Vin Diesel. It seems the US has jurisdiction in Brazil, but hey its a movie. From a chip in the vehicle, Vin Diesel discovers that the crime boss has money stored in various cash houses throughout the city. Walker and Vin Diesel assemble a Mission Impossible team to go after the cash. They attack the first cash house and burn the money which forces the mobster to relocate all his eggs into one basket. As it turns out, that basket is inside the evidence safe at the police station, making the task of that one last hit a bit more difficult. At this point the movie takes a few interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />The plot contains numerous implausibilities as does most Mission Impossible action movies, vehicles that can bust through concrete walls (that never use rebar), and don't even scratch the head lights. The ending will keep Myth Busters busy for a season.
Was this film part of the Fast and Furious series or "The Italian Job 2"? At times I wasn't sure. A lot less street racing and nice cars in this film, a lot more over-the-top action scenes and steroid-enhanced testosterone. Oh well, at least it was better than Tokyo Drift!<br /><br />Ranked in order of enjoyability:<br /><br />Fast and Furious (original)<br />Fast and Furious 4<br />Fast Five<br />Too Fast, Too Furious<br />Tokyo Drift<br /><br />It was kind of cool they brought some of the characters back from all the movies in the series but they kind of over did it I thought. At times the movie seemed too gimmicky to me.
It may be the best in the series...so far. This really is an ultra macho action movie. Good chases, fights, shootouts, and of course extremely expensive ultra fast cars doing all sorts of crazy things (amazingly w/ very few pedestrians or traffic). They blended a lot of the actors from the previous movies into this one. I enjoyed the Rock's character (Luke Hobbs), he played a real bad ass here and Vin as always plays the group's leader, the deep voiced, muscled up tough guy Dominic "Dom" Toretto. This film really makes the police in Rio de Janeiro look foolish and corrupt. Do they really drive those suped-up dodge charger police interceptor cars there? Somehow I doubt it. Apparently every city has an underground race club behind fences w/ hot girls that race thru the streets for "pinks" (a car's title). I don't know, I never see them. It's interesting they named the movie fast five rather than the fast and the furious 5. Anyways, it was a good action "guy movie". The downtown streets & bridge scene w/ Dom & O'Conner is killer. The guy who played the bad guy, Joaquim de Almeida, was also very good in his role. Very cool ending as well, although I wish they showed the final race instead of cgi everything. If you watch past the first few seconds of the credits they show a teaser for the next movie (scheduled may 2013) where apparently Michelle Rodriguez's character "Letty" is alive, Eva Mendes' character returns as well.
Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster team up again one final time for some more heart pounding adrenaline action. This movie takes place after Fast and Furious. The film brings the crew back together in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil for one last job to get their freedom before disappearing forever. Some of the previous stars through the past Fast and Furious films return, including Tyrese Gibson, (Roman Pearce - 2 Fast 2 Furious) Ludacris (Tej - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Gal Gadot, (Gisele - Fast and Furious) Matt Schulze (Vince -The Fast and Furious) and Sung Kang (Han - Tokyo Drift) all return for one of the most action packed Fast and Furious movies ever. They are faced with a tough federal agent Luke Hoobs (the Rock) who will stop at nothing to hunt them down. I will not give away any more but, I'm happy to say Fast Five does not disappoint. This Movie is action packed from start to finish, and even though it has many over the top moments it is still one heck of an enjoyable action ride. Just like the original film that started it all, this new and final installment will also have you on the edge of your seat. Don't listen to bitter critics, if you like a fun entertaining movie to take you away from your life for a few hours check this movie out! Im going to miss Paul and Vin and all the crew, but will be forever thankful for all the awesome Fast films they brought us and am happy to watch them again and again on DVD or blu-ray! Fast Five [Blu-ray]<br /><br />Be sure and stay for the end credits for a unexpected twist.

And last of all let's face it this movie was made for high-def fun. Btw stay-tuned after credits

Beware, the extended cut of the movie primarily adds minor content changes; there is one new scene, which is detailed below.<br /><br />The Extended Cut is slightly over one minute longer than the theatrical cut, most new scenes add just CGI blood, most of the time the blood being barely noticeable.<br /><br />1)  When Zizi's armed thugs attack Toretto's hideout, one of the thugs has his gun turned on himself by Toretto with CGI blood added in.<br /><br />2)  When Hobbs attacks three of Zizi's thugs in the favela shootout, there is re-inserted CGI blood when Hobbs shoots one and knifes the other.  The neck breaking of the last thug seems a little more brutal.<br /><br />3)  Hobbs' men fire on Zizi's thugs for a few seconds longer.<br /><br />4)  Slightly extended scene where Tej asks for a duplicate safe.<br /><br />5)  New scene: Discussion by Toretto's crew regarding breaking into the safe and transporting it.  They discuss the existence of the bathroom having a ventilation shaft which leads to the garage.  This scene then segues to Leo and Santos.<br /><br />6)  Toretto/Hobbs fight scene slightly longer and more brutal.<br /><br />7)  Chato receives a few bloody bullet rounds in the favela ambush scene.<br /><br />8)  Zizi's thugs are gunned down more graphically by Toretto's crew in the favela ambush scene.
This is just a great film. It's fun, it's loud, it's got story, and it's got gorgeous girls and amazing cars. That's the recipe for an awesome blockbuster. I'd heard the hype, and had always planned to see it, but I didn't know it would be as good as it was. it was just bada**. I came to Amazon the minute it was over to try and pre-order the Blu-ray--it is that good. Sure, it's cliche a lot of the time, but cliche doesn't have to be a bad thing. If you liked the original film then this is right on par with that--I think it's even better.I can't wait for the 6th one to come out!
This film is utterly amazing from the opening scene..I was quiet as a mouse the entire 2 hours of this whole movie..i just couldn't take my eyes off the screen or yelling wooo in excitement of the absolutely amazing action sequences.. very breathtaking some of the best action scenes since Bad Boy 2...Everyone was great from Paul Walker to the surprisingly  hilarious Tyrese Gibson..The Rock was just excellent and was an interesting and smart addition to the cast.. like I said everyone was great which also made the film an even better feeling in the end.I find it hard for any other film being released this summer season too be as good as this 1 right here..because Fast 5 was a summer blockbuster at it's ultimate best.Hands Down the best of the Fast franchise.!!!!!!!!!!!!! A
Movie - 4.5<br /><br />So I hadn't seen a single Fast & Furious movie prior to this. But I was browsing through Best Buy for my copies of other titles that came out that day when I saw the BB exclusive SteelBook edition. So for the first time in a while, I made a blind-buy based solely on the aforementioned packaging and the fact that The Rock was in it. I expected the preconceived notion that the other films had established (fast cars and hot girls), but was very surprised at how great of an action-heist-thriller this turned out to be. The story starts with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) being sentenced to prison (I'm guessing from F4), and then breaking out. Meanwhile, former federal agent turned fugitive, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) are on the run in Rio de Janeiro. They agree to take a job to steal some federally-impounded cars belonging to Brazilian crime boss Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). During the robbery a couple of DEA agents are killed, in which the U.S. government then sends DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to apprehend Dom and O'Connor. Like I said, I've not seen a single film in the series, so whatever character-building there was I don't know about it. I just thought it would be interesting for once to take a movie this far into the lineup, watch it, and see if I'd like it (which I really did). Oddly enough, there wasn't as much street racing as I thought there'd be considering that's what I heard to be the draw. The action in this particular entry, however, is pretty exhilarating. I've been wanting to see The Rock in another action flick since The Rundown and Faster, and it's good to see him back doing what he does best (can't wait to see him in G.I. Joe either). And from what little I'd seen of Vin Diesel, I thought he was a pretty good action guy himself. But to see both he and The Rock duking it out (quite viciously, too) was very cool to watch. On top of that, the last half hour with the vault heist and all the stunt work they had to coordinate is among the best I've seen from a production standpoint. If you haven't seen any of the Fast & Furious yet, I can wholeheartedly recommend you at least start here.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Fast Five is another one of those movies that was filmed on 35mm then digitally processed, and it looks perfect on this transfer. I was convinced after just the first few minutes when they were stealing the cars from the train that the image would be a stunner. Contrast displays itself best during this sequence showing a lot of fine detail throughout the interior shots of the train when O'Connor and Mia are walking through the passenger car, down to the car car (it sounds weird saying that), and to the point when they cut the walls out to take the cars. In particular, the details I'm talking about are the shadow delineation amongst the lighting, the fact that you can see many of the grains of sand blowing through the air, and even some of the hairs on O'Connor's arms when he jumps out and hangs on the escape truck. Furthermore, when things get darker (from a lighting perspective) the detail remains just as immaculate. For me, it was the articulation of Hobbs' sweat running down his head and all the way to his beard. You can see each individual bead even when its dark outside. Colors are also handled extremely well, most notably in the scene with the car congregation where all the flashy cars, lights, and colorfully scantily-clad women make for some great eye candy. There are no instances of any tinkering whatsoever and the picture is as clean as can be. From a cinematographic view, I was very impressed with a lot of the footage they were able to get or integrate using as little CG as possible. A lot of the overhead shots of Brazil and the favelas add a nice exoticism to the feel of the movie itself, and I hope DP Stephen F. Windon gets more work in the future. My favorite scenes for reference are the chase in the favelas for its overall balance in detail amongst all the chaos, the police Charger street race in the middle for some great black levels, the aforementioned car congregation for all the colorfulness it exudes, and of course the scene where Gisele is getting Reyes' hand print because it's detailed, colorful, and I'm a guy and thinks she looks really hot in a bikini.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />The DTS-HD MA 5.1 track here is every bit as captivating as the video. Oddly enough, Jon Taylor, the re-recording mixer, has worked on mostly romantic comedies or dramas in his career. He has a few horror and action titles under his belt, but considering how aggressive the sound is for Fast Five, I'm surprised his talents have been so underused. With that being said, though, whether you're a fan of the series or a complete newbie like me, the audio alone makes up a good third of the enjoyment. As I've noticed with a lot of other car-involving sound designs (particularly The Transporter series), a really good car can make for some cool sound effects. The first one you really get to hear is Dom's 1970 Charger. And holy crap, is that thing loud. Its first appearance comes in from the rear left and not only packed a floor-shaking rumble, but even managed to rattle the driver in my dinky old Yamaha tower speaker. And then you have the revving of the engines of the cars they steal off the train, and even the train itself, making for lots of noise. Dynamic range is especially proficient with a lot of the vehicles because of the various engine types, car builds, and the way in which they're used (some for racing, some for ramming, and others for towing). In addition, there's also a lot more gunfire than I expected for the supposedly racing-oriented film I thought I was going to get. When the chasing and shooting ensue, directionality and separation are outstanding. Much like the various number of vehicles shown in the movie, there are also various weapons as well. Something like 150 different guns were made for the film, and while I couldn't keep track of all the calibers and makes, I'll take their word for it based on what I heard. LFEs are a given if you haven't associated everything else about the sound design with bass already, which should also be apparent if you're familiar with the work of composer Brian Tyler (who puts a lot of bass into his music). My favorite scenes are the favela chase, the shootout with Hobbs' team, and that crazy vault heist sequence at the end that destroys and damages things all over the place.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Justin Lin)<br />With this being both the first F&F and Justin Lin-directed film I've seen, I was very surprised at how informational it was. Lin has a very candid tone and talks about a lot of the filming, the production, the themes he wanted to portray with the characters, the evolution of the franchise from the first to the fifth, and what it was like working with everyone involved. And for a director I'd never heard of prior to this, I have to say he sounds like he has a pretty good grip on things.<br /><br />- Deleted Scenes (HD; 1:40)<br /><br />- Gag Reel (HD; 4:17)<br /><br />- The Big Train Heist (HD; 7:37)<br />Deconstructing the production and stunt work of said heist. Particularly how they wanted to use as little CG and visual effects as possible and to outdo action sequences from the previous films. I think they succeeded.<br /><br />- Reuniting the Team (HD; 4:59)<br />The casting of the characters and actors from previous F&F films. Again, not having seen any of the previous incarnations I have no idea who's supposed to be who and what kind of emotional baggage they're carrying. But I'm glad they got Gal Gadot!<br /><br />- A New Set of Wheels (HD; 10:09)<br />Talking about all the cars they used here in F5 and how they sort of represent some of the characters. It's a pretty interesting take on car-to-character symbolism, especially in the case of the main characters.<br /><br />- Dom's Journey (HD; 4:55)<br />A look at the motivations and evolution of Vin Diesel's character. I never took Diesel seriously as anything more than just another action body playing the tough guy, but this feature actually sheds a good deal of light on the character of Dom Toretto.<br /><br />- Brian O'Connor From Fed to Con (HD; 5:55)<br />A look at Paul Walker's character across the series. Weird to see how much of a West Coast, middle class ricer he seemed to be in F2 with the blond hair and super Caucasian attire. Hard to think he progressed so much up to this point.<br /><br />- Enter Federal Agent Hobbs (HD; 5:50)<br />A look at The Rock's character. I love the fact that they even have him in this film. The guy is charismatic and brings a lot to the table with his natural ability to look, act, and be tough in any kind of action role he gets, yet appears so humble off screen.<br /><br />- Dom vs. Hobbs (HD; 7:31)<br />A breakdown of the big fight and the challenges faced in filming it. Both Diesel and Johnson talk about how they really respect each other and have wanted to work together for a while. Well, they got their chance, and boy did they give a good show.<br /><br />- On Set with Director Justin Lin (HD; 8:36)<br />A look at filming the Porsche test-drive scene. He seemed a little annoyed at the fact that the stunt coordinators and driver weren't giving him what he wanted. They did quite a few takes and had a lot of talk in-between. Thankfully, they got what they needed to.<br /><br />- Inside the Vault Chase (HD; 9:20)<br />A great look at how they put the logistics and production together for this thrilling sequence. This is one of the coolest action/heist sequences I've seen in a while. Some of it is visual effects, but a lot of it actually isn't. If you're interested in film-making in general, definitely check this one out.<br /><br />- Tyrese TV (HD; 6:35)<br />The actor goofing around on set. He talks to the camera, goes around and talks to Justin Lin and Ludacris, and then hypes himself up like only he can. If you like his personality and sense of humor, this is worth a look.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />A P-i-P commentary featuring 17 segments of behind-the-scenes footage NOT seen in the other features averaging about 3 minutes per segment totaling to another 50-ish minutes of total bonus features. There's also an option to turn on Scene Explorer during U-Control to show 3 versions of the train heist in PreVis, Dailies, and B-t-S all at the same time or just one a time (in which the single view will take up the entire screen). The U-Control feature is a little more cumbersome to sit through and navigate than Warners' Maximum Movie Mode or Lionsgate's Bonus View, but is still pretty informational.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />I've heard the F&F franchise is something of a mixed bag. Some people say it's good entertainment and others say it's a waste of time. Not having seen any of the previous films, I can't tell you what I think yet. But based solely on F5 alone, I have to say I'm pretty damn interested in seeing them now. F5, in particular, is a great heist flick with lots of action and style that ironically and apparently also has some of the long-rumored elements of The Brazilian Job (as in, the sequel to The Italian Job) in it. For whatever reason The Brazilian Job never made it out of production hell, nobody knows. But if the F5 crew did manage to sneak it in here, all the better. The video and audio are easily reference quality and the extras amount to well over 2 hours plus a great commentary. So if you're a fan of the franchise (I guess) or at least a fan of this installment, don't hesitate to pick it up and enjoy the ride.
I was recently stuck on a 14 hour flight and the selection of movies was not that great.<br /><br />Usually, I avoid action movies like the plague, but I decided to give this one a try.<br /><br />This movie is fantastic from start to finish, and seems to rise above its subject matter and origins.<br /><br />The cast are great, and they all look like they are having tremendous fun. Plus, not one of the parts has been underwritten - all of them have something good to say or something fun to do.<br /><br />My favourite was the Rock. He was wonderfully over the top in this movie, and he looks like he eats and drinks testosterone at every meal.<br /><br />This movie is great fun and will not leave you disappointed.
This one was different from the rest. There was a lot more drama, and talking, mixed with some action. I guess I had high hopes for even A LITTLE more racing scenes is this whole movie.  It was more of an action movie with guns and muscles than what the original The Fast and The Furious started with.  Even though the director said they're trying to "evolve", get away from the racing stuff. It was a little disappointing to only see one real race, which wasn't exciting at all.  Then when you think there's going to be a race, they edit it out completely.  Probably because we know whose going to win in the end, sure, but it's still fun to watch.  "The Rock" (Dwayne Johnson) was a great addition to the movie. His character in this playing "Hobbs" was hunting down Dom, Brian and the team.  Also bringing back some of the other characters from the four movies before his one was a great addition.<br /><br />I don't know, you be the judge.  If you like action movies with guns blazing mixed with some standard cars and destruction. Then you may like this movie.  If you only liked the other other fast and furious movies before this because of the street racing, cars, or feel of it.  You may or may not be disappointed.
When I first saw its trailer in the theatre, I thought it's going to be another bad sequel. How wrong I was! I have watched Fast Five both in the theatre and at home. Every time, I was absolutely entertained. That's the feeling I haven't got for a long time after watching action films.<br /><br />The excitement is non-stop from the beginning till the end. I'm sorry, I can't go into details here. Otherwise, it will ruin your excitement.<br /><br />The special effects with cars are the best that I've ever seen so far. Especially,  in the last scene where 2 cars pulled the vault into the street. Of course, I had to suppress my logic to enjoy the movie. If you like action scenes with cars, you don't want to miss this one.<br /><br />In short, this is the best of all action sequences. It's also one of the BEST that my MONEY CAN GET. I own a DVD copy of it.
I enjoyed "Fast Five"  when I first saw it in a darkened theater last April. I enjoyed it even more when I shared the DVD with my wife. What Danny Ocean did to Las Vegas, Dom Toretto does to Rio de Janeiro. He assembles a cool crew of specialists to take down a big-time crime boss. The action is (pardon the pun) fast and furious. When Special Agent Hobbs is added to the mix, you have a really volatile combination. It was fun watching Vin and Dwayne go at each other.<br /><br />The DVD is not big on special features, but the extended version adds a crucial minute that's missing in the theatrical version.
Remember back in the day when you were all wistful for Stallone and Schwarzenegger to be in the same movie or, on a subservient level, for Seagal and Van Damme to do something together? FAST FIVE is the best - and biggest - in the Fast & the Furious franchise for any number of reasons, but a big chunk of the hells yeah! stems from the Rock stepping into the series. You knew, you just knew, he and Vin Diesel would be champing at the bit to claim head chair in the pecking order. Adrenalin junkies are accordingly put on alert.<br /><br />FAST FIVE opens by replaying the closing sequence of the previous (and fourth) installment, with Dom Toretto's (Vin Diesel) being sprung during his transit to penitentiary. This prison - or, more accurately, prison bus - break is masterminded by former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who has now irrevocably crossed that line. This marks the first time that Walker and Diesel's characters are working on the same side for the entire length of the film. And yet that streak of competitiveness is still there. O'Conner is still earnestly obsessed with proving that he's the superior wheel man. Dom continues to humor him, probably trying not to smirk.<br /><br />Awesomely, FAST FIVE reunites the core cast of the previous four flicks, and I soaked in the cool factor of seeing Tyrese Gibson, Luda, Sung Kang, Don Omar, and Tego Calderon rub elbows with Diesel and Walker. Now fugitives from justice and finding stateside too hot for comfort, Dom, O'Conner, and Mia (Jordana Brewster) have fled to parts unknown. But when a daring Brazilian train caper goes south and ends up with Dom and O'Conner accused of murdering three DEA agents, in comes a relentless U.S. strike force ramrodded by the determined and growly Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). And right away you can feel the ferocity the Rock brings to his role. Oooh, I was anticipating the inevitable butting of heads.<br /><br />But that's just one of the story threads. The central one concerns our likable rogues' planning and orchestrating of one final huge score. Dom and O'Conner have aimed with ambition and with brazenness, targeting the primo drug kingpin in Rio de Janeiro. Except that this Big Bad is one careful, meticulous sumbitch, his stash of $100 million cached in ten holdings spread throughout the city and guarded by an army of corrupt cops on his payroll. The trick is how do you get to all ten stashes without ruining that element of surprise? It's pretty clever how Dom gets around this complication.<br /><br />FAST FIVE does present several good character moments which ground our cast, sort of. I say "sort of" because, honestly, this franchise's enduring global popularity is built around high-octane, wildly improbable, tremendously entertaining  action sequences (oh, and hot cars and hot chicks in skimpy clothing). But the franchise's stabs at a richer emotional tonality allow the viewer to accept the film's more absurd stunts or at least view them with a more expansive eye. We're treated to three audacious action set pieces (the epic train heist, the chase across the rooftops of a Brazilian slum, the runaway bank vault). We see the brutal, no-holds-barred Rock vs. Diesel fighty fight. We note the film's scorn of the laws of physics. It pays never mind to the logistics involving our heroes surviving a two-hundred-feet plunge into the drink or two cars hauling a bank vault while engaged in a car chase with a troop of police cars. It scoffs at the impossibility of fingerprints being lifted from a bikini. Except that these flaws don't bug me. I only point them out to demonstrate that I'm no wide-eyed daisy. I'm aware of the implausibilities, the ridiculousness of the stuff that goes down, as is director Justin Lin, if you listen to his audio commmentary. This film ain't for nitpickers; it'll be like target practice for them. For my money, FAST FIVE delivers enough solid character interactions, but, no, this isn't a Merchant Ivory production. Instead, it's all about the larger-than-life characters and their dangerous attitudes and it's about the stupendous wall-to-wall action. It's sheer escapism. And, also, maybe you should stick around for the closing credits.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff: Director' Justin Lin's Audio Commentary; 2 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:01:39 minutes); Gag Reel (00:04:17 minutes) and three featurettes focusing, respectively, on Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Dwayne Johnson and their character arcs: "Dom's Journey" (00:04:53 minutes long); "Brian O'Conner: From Fed to Con" (00:05:53); and "Enter Federal Agent Hobbs" (00:05:47).
really enjoyed the movie. hands down the best of the franchise so far. over the top and action packed! what more can you ask for? cannot wait for the next one!
enjoyed the movie good action look forward to the next in a series of high performance cars and speed with different locations
"The guys we're after are professional runners. They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way so make sure you've got your funderwear on. We find 'em we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back. And above all else we don't ever, ever let them get into cars."  After breaking Dominic (Diesel) out of the jail bus Brian and him move to Rio to start a new life of robbing and stealing.  After Brian gets news that makes him want to stop running the team decides to pull off one last heist.  I have never been a real big fan of the series.  They are good but have mostly been "I have car...I go fast."  The fourth one was the best because it actually had a story to it.  Then I saw this one.  Far and away the best of the series so far.  For those that watched them for the racing I should warn you, there is only one scene in this one.  This one was more in the style of "Oceans 11" then a "Fast & Furious" movie.  I'm not sure if the sixth one they are making is needed, but like all movies lately they will make them until they make one too many...then the remakes start.  That reason aside this is a very fun and exciting heist movie very much worth watching.  Overall, I surprisingly liked it a lot and highly recommend this.  I give this a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch it again? - I think I would, I can't say that about the other four.<br /><br />*Also try - Fast & Furious 1-4 & Takers
I own all the fast and furious movies, and I preordered this one. I loved fast five in the theaters, so I had to get this one for myself too!
I always thought these movies were fun.  The street racing, the drama etc but this film is on a new level.  Everything I got in the old version of the "Italian Job" that I did not get in the new one is all here.  A crazy con, stunts reaching new heights in the art and a great story.  This movie is a must if you liked the "Italian Job".  I am so getting this on blu ray.
Fun and entertaining, just what it  should be.  Went more the direction of a heist movie, but that's what made it work.  How many times can they keep reinventing the same car race & chase movies?  I liked the first four *okay*, they were entertaining enough, but this  one was much more refreshing than any of the other sequels  have been.  And don't  get me wrong, this is not  Oceans 14.  This is a tough-guy, fast-paced action heist  movie.  Maybe more like the Italian Job.
I was hooked from all the sexyness in the movie first. But when I watched it I also liked the plot. I would definetley reccomend. I especially like how they brought everyone from the others together. I also like the twist at the end after the crdits
The first Fast movie I saw was #4 and only because my son begged me to go.  The movie grabbed me from the opening shot, and didn't let go until the close.  I literally found myself trying to catch a breath at times.  Of course, I immediately had to go out and buy the first three.  #1 was so good I couldn't believe I'd missed it for all these years.  #2 was very good with at least one of the original cast and the addition of a couple of other good actors.  #3 was nothing like the others, but was, for what it was, watchable.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for Fast Five to open and was not disappointed at all.  We are huge Vin Diesel fans and love the Rock, so this was a real treat for us.  We've actually seen it twice at the theaters and will probably go at least one more time.  And I just preordered the DVD.<br /><br />No matter how you see it, though, sit through the credits for a real surprise!<br /><br />If you love good action movies, no matter how improbably they are (and really, anything else is just real life, isn't it), don't wait to see this one.
This is the best of the Fast and Furious movies in my opinion. It keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the beginning and never gets boring. Saw this in theaters and will definitely be buying it when it comes out! Make sure you keep watching until a couple minutes into the credits or you'll miss a very important part of the movie!
The Fast and the Furious franchise seems to be getting better with age. The first on was a good movie. Then the second one came out which was average at best than Toyko Drift came out and that was just plan terrible. I considered the franchise dead after that but then I saw Fast and the Furious and it gave life to the franchise. It's rare to see a franchise getting better with age. Usually Things start to go down hill after the second movie of a franchise. From the Lethal Weapon movies, to the Terminator movies and of course all of the horror genre. So it's surprisingly rare for a franchise to survive the test of time and you wouldn't expect this franchise to be one of them and Fast Five might be the best movie of them all.<br /><br />Fast Five has a above average story. Starting almost directly after the first one. The overall story is about the core group trying to find a way out of the endless running from the law and family. There's another plot about a drug lord and a missing computer chip but it isn't very good. That shouldn't matter to most simply because you don't go to see this type of movie for a amazing story and great acting. You coming to see the great action, cool cars, and hot women. You get plenty of all three in this. Still I'd say this is the best story of all the movies since the first one.<br /><br />The acting ok but look at the actors none of the are great actors and none of them are going to win Oscars in their acting career. Still all the actors from Paul Walker to Tyrese Gibson to Sung Kang to Dwayne Johnson aka THE ROCK are having a good time and have great chemistry which makes up for the acting.<br /><br />Now for what everyone goes to these movies for the action. Which is mind blowing. From a scene where a group steal cars from a moving train. Another was a on foot chase in slums of Brazil(Which the movie was filmed and is beautiful.) where Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel go one on one in one of the one one action scenes you'll see with out CGI. Finally there's the climax which I won't say anything about but will blow you away.<br /><br />Also there is a scene after the main credits that will imply what the inevitable next movie will be about.<br /><br />Overall this is the best of the franchise with great visuals and action and a above average story and decent acting.
Super entertaining, edge-of-your seat action movie that has it all. Don't take this movie too seriously and you'll have a great time. During some of the scenes the audience was laughing out loud (for example: the scene shown in the trailer where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are surfing on top of a car that is mid-air and plummeting into a canyon...oh yeah!)--but all in good fun. It's part heist movie, part racing movie, and part action/cop and robber movie. I've watched the Fast and Furious franchise from the beginning and I have to say that this is by far the best one out of all of them. I am highly anticipating the arrival of the next Fast and Furious movie.
The best Fast Five movie since the original.  I've never seen so many car crashes in my life.  Loved seeing all the original cast members and some new additions.  It was a thrill ride from beginning to end and then some.  It wasn't just action and no substance either.  The story was well thought out and very original for being the fifth movie in the series.  I didn't go in expecting but more of the same from before but I got much more.  Go see this movie or at least buy it on DVD when it comes out.  You'll be kicking yourself later if you don't.
The Fast and the Fiveous is a high octane thrill ride that speeds along at a frantic pace, leaving plot and character in the dust. But that's ok, because all we care about is who wins the race. The movie gets into gear with the opening scene and never lets up. Sure, it's low quality. I know, the writing is bad and the characters' choices make no sense. And yes, watching Vin Diesel try to smile is a painful experience. But in the end, you'll find the whole thing stupidly entertaining.<br /><br />In fact, it was so stupid that my brain sort of shut off while I was watching and I'm having serious trouble coming up with anything useful to say. Did I already mention that Vin Diesel fights The Rock? Basically, if that sounds good to you, you're gonna love this movie. Otherwise, steer clear. But if you feel like reading on, be warned that my mind is not firing on all six cylinders. Five Fast Five Furious picks up where the last one left off (as if anyone's keeping track), with Dom (Vin Diesel) in jail. It takes all of 30 seconds for some stunt driving to flip the prison transport bus he's on, sending Dom twirling towards freedom--and man does it flip, over and over and over and over, until it comes to its final resting place. Boom: title screen. What an opening. Though there were only 6 people in the theater, it immediately filled with cheers. The movie must have anticipated my fear for all those poor prisoners' lives, for shortly after the title, we get a news report assuring us that no one was harmed. Dom and co. would never hurt an innocent prisoner.<br /><br />From there, we launch into a kickass train sequence with all sorts of fighting and stunts that would leave the main characters dead a dozen times over (I'm looking at you, 500 foot fall off a cliff). But who cares? It's awesome! That's sort of the theme of Fiveous in case you hadn't noticed. Unlike Source Code, which fails because it tries to be smart but is instead riddled with errors, this movie succeeds with flying colors. It tries to be dumb, so we watch it on its own terms, accepting everything that doesn't make sense.<br /><br />For example, the characters are totally weak and one-note. Doesn't matter how many cops Vin Diesel kills. He's not a bad guy. He just loves his sister and gets put in tough situations. We feel so much empathy for that dude. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) isn't just a cop who turned against the force and became a car-stealing criminal. No, he's a guy with a wife. How can you not feel for him? Especially when his wife is extra hot. She is, after all, the lovely Jordana Brewster. She doesn't do a whole lot, but not only does she have an amazing body, but also she's pregnant. Gotta care about her if she's got a baby in her belly. The characters make all sorts of irrational decisions and have no depth, but they're exactly good enough.<br /><br />The cops are even worse though. Dwayne Johnson's motivations are all over the place, and his sexy partner lets her lust for Vin Diesel's muscles get in the way of her job time and again. In another film, these might be problems, but in Five Furious, everything's already so ridiculous we just don't mind. Like I said, we get to see Vin Diesel fight The Rock. That's all I need, and it's probably the highlight of the movie. My friends and I kept shouting "Ohhhh" when someone would land a particularly devastating blow (which happened like every other punch). I'm pretty sure the other 3 members of the audience were as into it as we were.<br /><br />When people weren't fighting or smashing things, the movie did start drag, however, and not the race sort of drag. Every once in a while I'd catch myself actually listening to the dialogue, which was a big mistake, because I'd overhear things like this: There's a basically uncharacterized Hot Girl repairing part of a car or something. The also uncharacterized Asian Guy walks up and says: "You really like doing that stuff, huh?" Hot Girl thinks a normal response to that question might be something along the lines of: "When your life is on the line--that's when you learn about yourself." Then Asian Guy says: "That's a fair deal." Deal? What deal? Are these people even talking to each other? The exchange makes absolutely no sense, which apparently gets Hot Girl off, cause next she flashes this overly flirtatious look, followed by a cut away. What a beautiful scene. But heck, when the two of them hook up while driving at the end of the film (very dangerous. do not recommend), I was happy for them. Why not?<br /><br />Why not? I'm pretty sure that's what the screenwriter must've said whenever someone questioned one of his scenes. But it works! I mean, this is an action movie first and foremost. Whether or not it's a good film boils down to one thing: how much did it kick ass? The answer to that question, my friends, is A Lot. I mean, Dom literally rips a 20 ton bank vault out of a wall. Before this movie, if you'd ask me how many times I could be entertained by seeing a giant bank vault smash a cop car while being dragged along the street chained to two sleek racing vehicles, I'd probably have said four or five times. But now I  know the truth. It's dozens and dozens of times. Scores of times! Vault smash this car. Vault smash that car. Vault smash one car. Vault smash two cars. I think the movie actually states that the vault smashes every single cop car in all of Rio. A very impressive feat by anyone's standards, to be sure.<br /><br />There ya go. Fast Five is pretty awesome. Shut off your brain and turn on your, I dunno, eyes? If you go to this expecting B-grade entertainment, you'll have a great time. Fast Five does a surprisingly good job of keeping up the excitement at all times, and as long as you don't listen to the dialogue, there won't be a single dull moment.<br /><br />3.5/5 <br /><br />Was anyone else constantly afraid that Mia might have a miscarriage when she was jumping off of roofs and crashing through windows and flying around hairpin turns?<br /><br />Check out more reviews on thenickelscreen
It's a fun movie,it has action and everything we love about the Fast and Furious series!! Get this movie it's not to be missed!!
This movie really rocked! I know there will be a part 6 coming, for sure... that even makes it more satisfying than ever!! Way to go, characters of Fast Five! Keep it up!!! Whooo!
this fifth installment to the fast and the furious movies is awesome. the original cast is back in this movie. This is a great movie a great adition to the series. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
Fast Five in my opinion is the best installment out of the 5 movies. The last one was awesome but this just had so much original action sequences with the dragging of a vault down the street causing havoc, cop cars racing and a truck you can use to steal cars off a train. Very fun movie with everything you want out of an action movie. Definitely recommended. And on a side note, the fight between the Rock & Vin Diesel is just bad a$$!
With Vin Diesel and the Rock Johnson beating down on each other you just can't beat this movie. I'd recommend it to everyone:)
Best movie of the series. the fast and the furious story continues with this amazing movie. would definitely recommend to anyone who likes car movies.
What do i say, well, Vin Diesel, he is the new Arnold! He has been for awile. mind the spellin. You want action VIN is the man! Vin Diesel that is, the movie is worth watchin and tellin everyone about!. More than worth the rental!. great movie Vin and THE ROCK were well worth it! Rent it!
I ordered and received the blu ray on time but it would not play. It kept freezing up and one time it stopped and returned to the main menu on it's on. I contacted Amazon and they promptly returned my money including shipping and even provide a return lapel at their expense. I was not happy with the disc but I am very pleased as to how I was treated by Amazon and I continue to purchase from them. I just wish that everyone treated their customers with the same level of customer satisfaction that Amazon does. They are a very reputable site and I am very pleased with them. I shop their site all of the time and just recently bought Richy Rich and two car alarm remotes and they were top notch products.
I don't know why so many people like this movie.Sure it had cool cars but that alone doesn't make it a good movie.I thought it was boring.I usually like Dwayne Johnson but I just didn't like him in this movie.I didn't really care for any of the characters except for Han.He's the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1.Maybe If I was a guy or if I was into racing,I would've like it better.This movie was to long and I was glad when it was over.
It was an entertaining movie and I'd watch it again, because of the action.  I found the dialog to be a bit corny and some of the behavior unnecessary (you found the hideout and they're on satellite.  Is it necessary to be fly'n thru the streets and bouncing around in your armored cars to get to their location?)
Worst out of the "Fast" franchise. Outrageously unrealistic. The whole thing was ridiculous. Would not waste my time on this.
Item arrived fast just like the movie and the DVD was excellent. As always antime I order from Amazon the service is excellent.
CANT WAIT TO GET THIS MOVIE FOR OUR SON FOR CHRISTMAS.... HE HAS ALL THE MOVIES... HE'S 9 AND LOVES FAST CARS! GREAT ACTION MOVIE THE WHOLE FAMILY ENJOYED!
Item arrived on time no problems at all. Both the DVD and the Blue Ray works great. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
This is my favorite Fast and Furious movie yet! Always keeps you on your toes and got it for a great deal on Amazon. Packaging and shipping was flawless, got it quick and safely packaged.
Awesome movie, great price and here ON release date!!  Who could ask for more!! Thanks for wonderful customer service as always.
I pre-ordered the new Fast Five DVD from Amazon a few weeks before it was to be released. I received the DVD in the mail on the exact date of release, it was great. The movie is awesome, I have already watched it so many times. I was very pleased with Amazon and how quick and easy it was to pre-order this DVD. It was also cheaper to pre-order from Amazon, then to pre-order it from Walmart or Target. I am very pleased with this transaction!
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO COME OUT AND ITS THE BEST ONE THEY MADE OUT OF ALL OF THEM.tHERE IS TONS OF ACTION IN THIS MOVIE NON STOP AND I LIKE IT CAUSE ALL THE ACTORS FROM ALL THE FAST FIVE MOVIES ARE IN THIS ONE JUST EXCITING.This is a must see movie!
I was alittle bummed that it didn't come in a purple blue ray case even though it is a blue ray/dvd combo, it comes in a dvd case. Thats the only reason why I gave it 4 stars, the movie was a 5 star.
Great addition to the Fast and Furious movies. Bringing The Rock into the series was a great move and I can't wait to see him in another sequel. Awesome action and good story.
I got it as a gift, and it was long overdue!! I wasn't able to see it in theaters when it came out, but I was able to watch it three times in a row at home!!!<br />Action and humor packed, worth getting for the fans of Fast and Furious franchise. The Rock brought an interesting dynamic to it. The end leaves me wondering if there will be another Fast movie...............
Great cast, awesome popcorn flick and eye candy. Vin Disel and the Rock need I say more ;-)I have always enjoyed the Fast and Furious series. And with the cliff hanger at the end (no spoilers) I can not wait until the next installment :-)
movie rocks...digital download takes FOREVER....thanks universal for saving a couple dimes on cd discs...i'm gonna send you the bill for the 17+hrs required to download this bad boy
i say this movie was the best one out of all of the others. this movie have less racing but more explosions and fighting so if you like seeing things blow up you probably like this movie. what i didn't like was they exaggerated on some of the stunts.
Lots of action, decent plot, all the stars back from the other movies, what more could you ask for? They set it up nicely for the 6th installment also. Looks as though Letty will be back also which would be good. Eva Mendez looks to be reprising her roll as well in the 6th installment. If they keep putting out good movies like this keep it going.
I still consider "The Fast and the Furious" to be the best in the series, but "Fast Five" comes very, very close.  All five movies constitute the purest of popcorn entertainment, which is why they're so terrific.  This one, as Amazon's reviewer points out, borrows quite a bit of its plot from "Ocean's 11," but it does so in a sufficiently inventive way (I don't recall George Clooney dragging a bank vault attached to his sportscar through the Vegas streets in that one).  You also need to have seen the first four movies in order to really appreciate the fifth installment (since most of the supporting characters from those movies reappear).  And, I must admit, I didn't particularly like the end-credits "twist," which simply doesn't fit (without spoiling things too much, it reminded me of the final shot in "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest").  Otherwise, "Fast Five" is a classic.
it was a great movie the beginning got me pumped up and once it was over i just wanted to drive. i have to sat the 4th movie was the best anf fast 5 tied with the 1st and 2nd movie and Tokyo drift just sucked
ok if you want reality stay away from the movies.  if you want a break from reality and a good time that has fast cars and some seriously awsome driving then watch this movie.  they pull a safe out of a wall with two cars.  is this reality no but is this an awsome way to steal some crooks money oh yeah!  The fight scene holds no limits and will be hard to top in the future fasts.  I am waiting to buy it and add it to my collection.  i hope in the deleted scenes they have vins race for pinks.  watch the movie and you will know what i mean.
this movie is awesome. bought it for my fiance so he will be surprised at christmas this year. went to the theatre to see this and was wowed by the best fight scene between The Rock and Vin. definately a double thumbs up for this one. can't wait till part 6 is released.
I remember seeing the first one and being wowed by it. I was just a kid, so of course it was something for me. I was 10 and saw it with a few friends and loved it. However I can't recall being impressed with a single sequel since then. Especially the puke fest that was "Tokyo Drift". 2 Fast was boring as hell and FAF seemed very slow and unfocused.<br /><br />So I didn't expect much from this movie... and all I can say is WOW.<br /><br />This movie was actually not bad for once. I can't believe for the first time I am able to say I enjoyed a TFATF sequel.<br /><br />The plot isn't anything original or groundbreaking- but the movie is well aware of it, and just piled on the action. That said, even the unoriginality was entertaining- the setting of Rio, a mob boss' money, the robbery of the money, etc.<br /><br />The action is intense and involving- I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in movies 2-4, so this was much needed. Furthermore, the finale, where two cars transport a bank vault (not ridiculous enough for you?) was incredibly fun, as was the shootout and roof-jumping scene.<br /><br />The humour was evident- the script was like Aaron Sorkin wrote an action movie. I loved the scene where the bomb goes off in the toilet pipes, causing a rain of poop in all the stalls, as was the police car racing scene, etc. Great balance of humour and action.<br /><br />The cast was great too- Vin was his usual cool self, but gotta say, Tyrese Gibson stole the show!!! I loved how he said "Say What?" at every impossible situation. The Rock was fantastic as well- I was looking forward to seeing him in it, and he did a fantastic job.<br /><br />My one complaint was that the movie was a smidge too long- maybe 10 minutes should have been trimmed, but ah, what the hell I had fun.<br /><br />You know what... give the crew a cookie, they did a good job with this movie, they made it fun and entertaining, and therefore even if you hate the franchise, the movie stands out on its own well.
Minus the "Bourne" and "Transformers" series, action films aren't my thing. The characters usually should've died several scenes before and the action scenes usually last too long. In "Fast Five," I won't deny that there were definitely some suspicious scenes that made me think, "How in the world did you escape being shot by THAT many people?" and why would you do THAT knowing your physical state (no spoilers!) right now? But something about fast car movies always makes me want to give them a pass. Roman Pierce (Tyrese's character) cracks me up so I was wondering how him and Dom would get along. Throw in Vin Diesel against The Rock, Tyrese and Paul Walker, and you have one easy winner of a film. The idea of two men big enough to make me remember Cedric the Entertainer's joke about Vin Diesel being "half car" going at it made me cringe. When Vin Diesel and The Rock started fighting, all I kept thinking was, "They're going to kill each other without any weapons necessary." It was like watching weights slam into each other at a gym. I really had no idea who would win, but it was fun to watch. Although I cringe about knowing Paul Walker likes to hunt in real life, he's gorgeous so any scene he was in, I was looking at him solely. Well, minus when Tyrese was onscreen, who I think is equally gorgeous. But what I love about Brian O'Conner is how easily he seems to fit in with any crowd. I don't think many actors could play Brian O'Conner's role in a believable way, not with characters like Vin Diesel, Tyrese and Tego Calderon surrounding him. The pretty boy looks are put on the backburner when you put him in a car. I've been a fan of Tyrese in the singing and acting business since he started so I'm an easy supporter of his career, and if there's anything Vin Diesel is in, I'm going to be in somebody's movie theater watching it.<br /><br />Cons: I miss Letty. I wasn't really convinced about any of the female characters. I'm sure they were eye candy for the fellas, but I actually BELIEVED Letty (played by Michelle Rodriguez) could carry her own the exact same way as the guys. Yeah, I know she died in a previous version, but I miss her. The rest just seemed like cute arm candy, kinda like Suki in "2 Fast 2 Furious." I wish there was at least one female character who was entertaining and strong. I was very amused by Eva Mendes' role with Tyrese in "2 Fast 2 Furious," but the women in this particular film seemed like a bunch of the same. *shrug*<br /><br />But with that said, this film is still five stars. I don't know why it took them so long to realize the "invisible" cars they needed and I was pretty sure what the ending would be before I saw it so the surprise factor wasn't there, but I'll definitely be buying the film when it comes out.
This film is a great example of why discriminating movie buffs could care less if hollywood fell off a cliff. There is absolutely NO TALENT in screen writing these days. These folks seem to think that all we need is a lot of BS stunts and CGI effects and we'll just drop to our knees in praise of them. As one other reviewer clearly observed, the stunts and some of the story line were SO ridiculus until it made the whole story unbelievable and utterly unrealistic. When I'm watching a supposedly non-fiction movie the one thing I absolutely can not stand is to have my intelligence insulted!  This movie does this hands down, so much so until it should receive an honor for its efforts.  In my opinion, Rock, Vin and Tyrese gave the best acting efforts...very matured and natural acting skills. I really like Paul Walker but he should take more acting classes because a lot of his lines sound too artificial...sounds like he forces his delivery too much.  Their ridiculus stunts were too much for me, they borrowed scenes from Clear and Present Danger (the ambush that killed all of Rock's men but curiously kept him alive eventhough he was in the middle of the street with NO protection against rapid gun fire), and, to me, borrowed too much from the Ocean's 11 & 12 themes (with the crew of 7 or 8 guys that all had different specialties, tired). The two Challengers that pulled a bank vault at high speed down the highway was just stupid...no snapped cabled, no rear ends being jerked out, not to mention the overwhelming effect the massive vault-weight would have had on the cars themselves.  It just got dumb at that point.<br /><br />It was amazing to see that Brazil had Dodge police cars like America...I really didn't know that. I also thought it strange that a DEA task force of 4 or 5 men could come into another country and operate all willy-nilly without ANY cooperation with the hosting country other than one "translator" that ends up being Vin's love interest at the end credits. I'd like to see some other country come into America and try that!  Anyway, glad I didn't reward hollywood with a box office receipt for this (this is the main reason I don't spend money at the theatres today). There's worst entertainment for sure, but really disappointing for supposedly a solid franchise, and the fact that this movie took in over $640 million worldwide. What does that say about our moviegoers today?!?!  One last thing, fire the director from future projects for putting crap like this out!<br /><br />Thanks!
i have quite a few blurays and hddvd's and they are all uniform height. i have adjusted the shelves to fit them. So i order this bluray and it comes in a FULL SIZE CASE that now will now fit on my shelf. NOT COOL, very dissapointed.
I have to say that if you miss whatserfuss, you need to buy this movie and watch the end.<br /><br />Awesome!!
A great set-piece and stunt near the beginning of the movie and a marvelously destructive chase scene at the end but nothing much between the two events.  Fans of the franchise will no doubt be well pleased.  Fans of knuckle-headed action movie can probably find better stuff to waste their time on.  'A-Team' for example was a much better knuckle-headed waste of time.
Most movie franchises, by the time they reach the fifth entry, have lost a lot of the original luster.  This is one of the excpetions.  There is nothing particularly new--the characters are still on the wrong side of the law, they still do things with cars most of us wouldn't dare to dream about and they look good while doing it.<br /><br />The new wrinkle in this one is The Rock--excuse, Dawyne Johnson--as a super Fed hot on their tails after they get wrongly accused for the murders of some federal agents.  But rather than running, the crew decides to pull "one last job so they can retire".<br /><br />None of this is original, and plot and logic errors abound, but they still manage to put together a very enjoyable film, especially the third act, which gives us the most vehicular mayhem seen since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO446">The Blues Brothers [Blu-ray</a>].
As understood, nice police officers had justice taken in their hands by stealing voult of not nice guys from a storage.<br /><br />Near a sci-fiction story with blood, murdering and questionable moral.
What makes a good action flick? Who knows for sure? But this one has it all, whatever it is!<br /><br />The family is back, and this time, they are re-recruiting many of the actors from the other four F & F's. As an added bonus, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and the 5'3" extreme hottie, Elsa Pataky, are on board as well. ALL of the F & F flicks are a bit short on storyline, but who needs a lot of pondering, yawn-inducing love stories, and brain-damaging twists to make the best picture of the spring? Not Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, or Paul Walker, that's for sure.<br /><br />After Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) break Mia's brother, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), out of a bus transporting prisoners to their final destination, prison, we soon find them all shacking up in South America. Although the entire train scene was edge-of-your-seat, the real white-knuckled fun starts in Brazil, and there ain't too much "shacking up" going on here either. The story is a bit thin, so for me to elaborate on it would give it away in totality, however, I can tell you that the story is exactly what it's supposed to be...perfect and not too over-the-top for what the movie is trying to do, which is bringing on the action, relieving the tension with occasional humor (VERY funny stuff, by the way), the rooting for the good guys (who are essentially bad to a degree), the serious love between the Toretto's (Dom, Mia, and their brother, Vince), and their love for O'Conner. It's a tight-clique buddy-flick, like "The Losers" and "The Expendables," but MUCH better than the former and even a bit better than the latter.<br /><br />All of the five-star reviews you're seeing on Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes, and Blu-Ray.com are the real deal. You honestly feel for these people, and you care what happens to them. The action sequences are top-notch, well-filmed, and superior to anything I have seen recently, or ever, for that matter. There is some truly incredible stuff going on here...especially the whole vault scene, which was absolutely awesome, to say the least.<br /><br />If you like action flicks, PLEASE don't miss this one. It has everything you're looking for and more. Also, make sure you stick around for a final scene after the credits roll. This scene tells us that there is NO QUESTION about a F & F Part Six coming up in the near future.<br /><br />One more note: If you haven't seen any of the first four movies, at the very least, watch the first one, "The Fast And The Furious," before checking out "Fast Five." It will get you in tune with the main characters. I believe it would be hard to pick up on the depth of these people without knowing some of their back-stories first.<br /><br />Fast Five is the best movie of the spring so far and one of the best action movies ever made. FIVE STARS HARD! *****
I'm on the same boat as J.G. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I am a huge fan of the series having bought the DVDs and the Blurays for all 4 (so far) so I Was really looking forward to this. Throughout the movie there were a lot of suspension of disbelief (as you should) in any movie. Mainly on what cars can and can't do but there are some things that go to far.<br /><br />If it would have been in the context of fantasy (Harry potter casting a spell and a giant magical elephant pulls the safe out the window, or Yoda uses the force and pulls it out) Then YES by all means I can be like "oh well it's a movie. The force is strong within him".<br />However, when it's 2 real cars pulling a real safe out of a wall I just can't swallow it. I really ruined the movie for me and should for anyone that's ever watched Mythbusters. More than likely they would have just sat there spinning their wheels until their tires exploded or the cable would have snapped.
when i found out they were coming out with another one, i got excited and wanted to watch it, but i didnt have high hopes, i mean come on...5 movies, there is rarely ever five sequels that come out and are stil good and fun to watch...there are movies where the second one blows horriblely, so like i said, no high hopes...but i was far from wrong...i really loved this movie..i think that it might be my favorite out of all of them...i saw a comment that said that you couldnt give it five stars cus it was far from perfect and unrealistic...i mean its a movie...i never really go into a movie and expect it to be down right perfect and believable...i mean i go for the entertainment, and this movie really did the job, i cant wait for it to come out so i can by it...i mean you cant judge a movie by it realistic state, i mean i guess you can, but what fun is that...so anyways, for any fast and furious fan that hasnt seem this movie yet, i highly recomend it, i would def. recomend for your collection(if you have one)(i do ;))
Just got out of the theater & I must say- This movie ROCKS!!!<br />Great Plot/Story Line... A lot better than the last 3...<br />This movie is full of Thrills, Action, Drama & great sound!!!<br />The special effects are AWESOME, but not too over the top!!!<br />It was a Huge Bonus bringing the Originals back!!!<br />All of the original actors fit their roles perfectly & the Dwaye Johnson fit his new role great! He added a lot of Intensity & his usual Flair... He also brought extra action in a Fantastic Fight scene with Deisel... Muscle vs Muscle!!!<br /><br />There is some Racing like usual, but this installment has a lot better story & is more of COMPLETE movie...<br />Paul Walker & Diesel didn't miss a beat with there on screen chemistry like they had in the First movie in the series!<br /><br />The Chase Scene at the end of the movie is the BEST CHASE SCENE since The Elanor Chase Scene in the Gone In Sixty Seconds movie with N.Cage!<br /><br />Also, just like usual many people left when the end credits came on, but if you stay through the credits,  you will be rewarded with a nice little SURPRISE!!!<br /><br />I give this movie an A & would recommend going to see it on the Big Screen!!!<br />I might just go and see it again!!!<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review!
I only went to see this in theatres because friends where going, and I had nothing better to do. I expected this to be just another installment of the Fast & Furious franchise of movies, with a few drag races for pink slips, a brush with the law, and a few action scenes... and yes, that all was in this one, too... but there was so much more that I was not expecting to happen, and by end of this film I was glad I had gone to see it.<br /><br />The movie kicks off right where the last left off. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is broken free from his jail sentence with the help from Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who has now instantly gone from a cop to a wanted criminal. They head down to South America and cook up a scheme to make a few bucks to start a new life. So the plot doesn't sound like much, they never really did before, did they? But I can assure you that the movie has some great action scenes, and not just involving the cars this time. Now that Brian is a wanted man, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is added to the franchise as a special forces (CIA?) cop named Hobbs. The Rock seemed too buff for the role, and seemed to be overacting the stereo typical role of the muscle buffed military style leader who will not take no for an answer, but he didn't take away from the acting anymore then Vin Diesel does... ok, enough bagging the acting, because it's been no better in any other one of these movies... so why am I saying this movie is rated 3 and a half to 4 stars? The ACTION! Some of the chase scenes in this movie are the best I have seen in years, even fans of car chases in James Bond and Death Race should enjoy the ones occurring in this movie, or in particular, the closing few minutes of the movie. It really came as a surprise to me, as the movie kind of started off with action, then had some more action, then got a little boring with all the sentimental characters manly love for each other, then in the end all of a sudden ....BOOM!!!!... and I wondered to myself "Where did that come from?". It seemed like something fans of Oceans 11 (the remake) would love. A cleverly put together little plot that is full of twists, turns, explosions, crashes and a whole vault of excitement.<br /><br />I don't know if everyone will agree with me, but this Fast & Furious, for me, is the best of the whole series. I definitely recommend you see this, if you enjoy the types of movies I mentioned, and this will sure be a DVD/BlueRay disc or two worth purchasing in a few months time.<br /><br />The reason I can't give it 5, isn't because of The Rock or Vin Diesel trying to out-do each other for an Academy Award, but because a few scenes in the middle needed to be trimmed down, and the final scenes after the awesome car chase needed to be shortened way down... the whole "where are they now"/ "And they lived happily ever after" things shouldn't go on for as long as they do in this. But apart from that, if you do see this, expect to see one of the best car chase scenes in a movie... EVER!<br /><br />Update: DVD REVIEW. The DVD contains the theatrical and directors cut of the movie. The extended version has a deleted scene put back in about the lead up the end scheme, and a bit more blood during a gun battle towards the end of the film. Other then that, it's not very noticeable. There is a small featurette like extra where the cast and directors talk about the cars of the film, as well as two extra deleted scenes. The DVD transfer has been great, as expected, and watching it again I was able to get more into the film and understand the development scenes, so I take back what I said and I think the film has a much better flow the second viewing. Still a great get away scene at the end of the film, and I still say it's one of the best, and again, the best F&F movie so far.
Why do so many guys like this movie? Vin Diesal is an awful actor! He thinks that good acting is strutting around flexing his big bulging biceps, knocking guys out to prove how big and bad he is. The stunts in this movie were kind of funny to me. Like how he and Paul Walker manage to survive that fall off that cliff jumping off the hood of the car! And how when the bad guys catch them and cuff them to the ceiling Vin Diesal easily breaks out of the cuffs and pounds the dudes to a pulp! Hmm yeah right? Paul Walker is a great actor but he gets easily overshadowed by big bad Vinny! They shouldve gave him a stronger role. Loved The Rock too! He was able to keep his machismo under control. I cant believe they're making a 6! Stop already!
I had heard pretty good things about this movie; that it was by far the best of the series etc....It really wasn't that good.  It was ok, for an action movie, but not worth the $20 for a blu ray.
We went to see this the weekend it opened and it was fantastic. When the Rock and VinDiesel have their fight scene it was like watching two massive bulls go at it. If you missed it on the big screen watch it on the biggest flat screen you can find. It will make a difference.
The original cast is back (sans one) and they are aiming to pull off a heist after putting together a team. The Rock is a welcome addition to the franchise as a federal agent who specializes in tracking down fugitives. There is a lot of excitement in this one, with the distinctive storyline of the bad guys being the good guys because they are stealing from worse guys. It makes sense when you see it. Are there some improbabilities that occur during the course of the action? Certainly, but if not taken too seriously, this is a good old-fashioned action film.  Car chases, gun fights and explosions are ubiquitous in Fast Five, and if that is your idea of a good time, sit back and enjoy the ride.
Yes its a small issue, but when you buy a Blu Ray it should come in a blu ray case.  All I have are blu rays on my shelf and this one doesn't fit.  Needs to be the little blue jeweled case like all other blu rays.
The last three sequels hardly offered anything new, you just had more fast cars and more races. So I didn't expect much from Fast Five at all. However the movie is surprisingly fun and exciting, due to better writing and direction.<br />  The fast cars and races are still in the movie of course, but here you have the addition of a Ocean 11 like heist plot and the Rock as a relentless special agent named Hobbs that will do anything to get Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel) and his team.<br />  I just don't understand why Han (Sung Kang) from Tokyo Drift is back with no explanation to how he's still alive, since didn't he die in that movie ? But that's easy to ignore since Fast Five is fun either way and the best action film of the year so far.
Thank so much. I got the DVD earlier than I expect. The picture, audio everything was perfect.Keep the good job.<br />Thank you.
Look, it's not really about the money. Money comes and money goes. It doesn't love you. You shouldn't love it back. How could you have any self-respect? That's why I'm always in the gym working out at the bench press. Sometimes I'm in the tanning bed. I special order those tiny big-boy tees.<br /><br />No, it's about family. It's about all my friends. It's about kicking back with some brewskis and making sexist comments when our Penthouse Pet cohorts are looking the other way.<br /><br />It's about recklessly endangering lives of pedestrians and other drivers, and destroying millions of dollars of city property wherever in the world we choose to go. Like I said, it's not about the money, but god forbid you have more money than me, and I happen to get wind of it. I'm sorry, did I kill your puppy while I was on my driving spree? Just having a bit of fun, me and the boys, didn't you see my dastardly yet charming grin after your car blew up?<br /><br />You see, it's all about freedom. So if you don't get out of my way, I'll have to kill you.
Though I bought and downloaded the HD version, the portable copy that I moved to my Galaxy Tab 10.1 is so grainy Toreto looked like bald Mario on Atari. I suggest Amazon would offer a variation of movie video screen size formats to match with a portable player, not just "one screen size fits all".
La pel&iacute;cula brinda al espectador lo que espera de ella: Acci&oacute;n - Adrenalina. Est&aacute; salpicada con escenas de humor que hacen interesante la trama. Los actores... Wao!!! Pero el final, despu&eacute;s de los cr&eacute;ditos... ofrece a los que hemos seguido con inter&eacute;s la historia, una chispa de expectaci&oacute;n de cara a una sexta entrega.<br /><br />The film gives the audience what it expects: Action - Adrenalina. Is peppered with scenes of humor that make an interesting plot. Actors ... Wao! But the end, after the credits ... offers those who have followed with interest the story, a spark of anticipation ahead of sixth F & F.
This part of the Fast and Furious franchise was the worst of them all to me. Some people may think diferentely about it but I thought it was horrible and too long and drawn out. Hang it up guys.
Throughout the entire saga, it has always been about cars and the street racing scene... You had RX-7 (twice), Supra (twice), Skyline GTR 33, Skyline GTR 34 (twice), Evolution (twice), that super sexy Veilside RX-7 in Tokyo Drift, the monster Doge Challenger with the massive blower sticking out, S2000 (twice), Saleen Mustang, Corvette, Doge Viper, super trucks, NSX ,RX-8, Silvia, and 350Z just to name a few and most of these cars were in involved stunts that anyone who claims to be mildly interested in cars will find exciting.... Sadly, this movie does not have that aside from a short drifting sequence which was a bit played out since you had a whole movie dedicated to drifting, right!?<br /><br />I had much higher expectations for this movie, I'm not saying that it wasn't tolerable, but it was more about the characters Dom and Brian than it was about the cars the street racing scene than the rest of the saga... you could have taken away the Fast & Furious name and it would have worked even better as a movie... because people didn't have those expectations associated with the name.<br /><br />The movie  is exciting, at times predictable, and I think playing to the drum of Hollywood where everything is Brazil these days, but that's fine too. The addition of all those characters from the entire saga was cool to see but they added little value to resolving the plot... I mean adding so many super drivers didn't do something that say other drivers that Dom could have rustled up in Brazil could have done...<br /><br />Now... my biggest tiff with this movie... The cars! Sure there were some really cool cars there, like the Classic Vette (a monster of a car!), Ford GT40, Dom's Doge, the Porsche, 350Z, and a few others... but the cars didn't really do much besides that short drift sequence!! Less than 5% of the movie! Really think about it... compare it to the other movies in the saga... there's not much there about the cars themselves... it was more about the characters and resolving a situation / plot!<br /><br />I'm not going to even discuss the ending with safe stunt... I think others have torn the flesh off of that one enough! But the ending... oh man, how can you just end it with a shot of the GTR and the Doge like that... you had a brand new GTR and you never used it for the movie!!! RETARDS!!! Had they not done that at the end I would have been much happier with this movie!! It should have been more about the cars and the street racing scene!
I left after half way through this movie. Why is everyone scream and fighting each other in this movie? It was like going into a bad high school or a jail cell. Stealing cars and hiding them? Yah right, I'm pretty sure these low-life characters can get away with that. And what chick wouldn't want to get knocked-up by some guy who steals cars for a living, not to mention constantly getting chased by the authority and the Latino "mafia". This is like the Latino Jersey Shore with fast cars. By the way, you combine Brian O'Conner and the Rock character to get the Vin Diesel character. They were all like cry-babies, always dramatizing the situation, no wonder they couldn't get anywhere in life. 1 star because I cannot give it 0 star. I will put on another star because I like fast car, but take off another star because American cars are ugly. So there you have it 1 star for this lovely movie. Save your money, if you want to see fast cars just Youtube it lol.
I don't know if this movie is good or bad. As soon as I try to play it on my Playstation 3 it locks it up hard and I'm forced to unplug it to shut it down.<br /><br />I'm forced to rate this at 1 star for being the only brand new DVD I've ever had that won't work on my PS3. I have also made sure to update my PS3 to the latest version.
I purchased this product because the title of the product advertised "... + Digital Copy in DVD Packaging"<br />I was extremely upset and dissapointed when I found that the digital download code had expired and is not redeemable.<br />Misleading Advertisement!!
The movie was fantastic but,has horrible language in it.You can't see a good action movie anymore without it saying offensive language and it was a dissapointment.
I bought this for a friend who likes movies with no plot beyond car crashes, explosions, bullets flying, and women with long hair.  He loved this movie. Say no more.<br />I watched the movie at his house with Wall-O-Sound or whatever it is that blasts the noise at you loudly from all directions. It is used effectively in this movie. It is overused so frequently that I advised him to check his house foundation after the movie.
I ordered this movie which was supposed to be in "brand new perfect condition", I received it far from promptly which wasn't was a big deal but when I opened the package the case was smashed in (when it was stated case in perfect condition, still in orginal wrapping and everything) and also when I played the movie it had a glitch in it (the movie freezes during one scene)I had to start the movie all over and fast forward to the next chapter completely. So that was upsetting considering I was expecting a movie in brand new condition which obviously means no scratches or skipping. The movie itself I loved, first time I saw it (which is why it was even more frustrating I had to miss the whole part where it stops working, during the last car chasing scene too!)
You can't give this movie 5 stars...you just can't. It is far from perfect, also it is cliche'.  Oiled up muscle bound guys looking straight out of the gym, hot ladies in slim bikini's, racial jokes, stereotypes, people walking in slow motion while explosions disperse behind them and they are unaffected in their motivational attitude, impossible survival scenes that would kill you 100% of the time, etc.  BUT...if that stuff is what you are looking for or doesn't bother you, this movie is very enjoyable.  There were parts of this movie as a cynic I was like "hey wait a minute".  But after my girlfriend was like "It's just a movie".."just watch it"  I sat back in the theater and thought well then to heck with it and it was very enjoyable.  Like an adult cartoon.  Sure characters:  how they got this and that, where they came from, how they knew this or that and how two cars can drag a few ton safe down the road at speeds other than 3 miles an hour suspend you belief a little too much, its still fun to watch.  Lin is a fantastic director.  Not cookie cuttering a movie together that gives you a headache with repetitive violence and zero interesting story (see he horrid Transformers movie).  He splices the scenes together without using the same rehashed pans and cliche shots and sounds that everyone else uses.  Vin Diesel who honestly is a horrible actor...seriously he is just plan awful has about as much personality and as a stapler and his acting consists of looking like he has to go to the bathroom and flexing in a tank top.  But for this movie that is all that is required.  He is as usual the bad boy with a heart of gold that never loses or gets frustrated when things go wrong and people die.  He shows about as much depth as possible when he sinks his head and in one scene seems to be looking at his biceps while he tries to pass gas.  Such vulnerability, its a wonder he never got past these movies.  The Rock Johnson, is the new addition and does the usual dual bad boy generating a hint of humor with a stone face that has made him likable in any scenario of action or anger.  The Rock has the biggest arms on screen of any of the muscle men in the movie...of course they are oiled up in every shot but its The Rock, who cares.  He also is always sweating, who would have thought a Samoan couldn't take Rio heat.  His character however suffered because he was the more interesting of the angles in the movie but wasn't explored in a manner that would have made this movie a little better.  There is one gap that he is missing from frame for almost 30 something minutes to where you almost forget he is in movie.  Like I said the chicks are hot, the Asian guy eats some kind of bagged item, Luda and Ty make black jokes and impossible things happen which is per order of the movie.  My favorite being how they infiltrated the police station.  After causing a septic problem in the bathroom two good goons pretend to be plumbers and carve a huge part of the cement wall so they can cut into the security mainframe...how did they patch this hole to where it would be undetectable is unknown.  It wasn't even close to the toilets.  Another is the fight between Rock and Vin, busted up faces and bruises vanish as soon as the scene changes to 5 minutes later going down the road in the squad car.  REGENERATION POKEMON!!!  Still I found this movie filmed well and very enjoyable.  It never stalls or drags and never has overkill.  I recommend you get this.
In 2001, the first film in The Fast and the Furious franchise was released in theaters. And truth be told, until now it was the only film in the franchise that I'd seen. The films are all about cars and little to nothing else, so if you're like me and are the rare breed of man who doesn't give a crap about cars then the franchise isn't really something you're incredibly enthusiastic about. Ten years and over $955 million worldwide box office dollars later, Fast Five, the fifth film in the franchise, has been released. Fast Five is over the top in every sense of the word yet still doesn't stray too far from what fans love about the franchise.<br /><br />Fast Five is mostly outrageous car sequences for over two hours. Just crazy and practically impossible stuff that Criss Angel would be pressed to pull off on his best day. The use of CG during the finale of the car chase with the bank vault is probably the best example. Hell, anything with the cars pulling the bank vault through the city really. Maybe it's because I skipped three movies, but a handful of insanely talented drivers trumping an entire police force seems really ridiculous to me. Not to mention the main drug lord in Rio. Remember Alien vs Predator? Both movies were awful, but just think of what could have been. One of the things that made the Aliens so dangerous was their vast numbers. I mean the second movie was mostly one Predator against an entire battalion of Aliens. Despite how well the Predator first started off, he eventually gave in to the massive horde of Aliens. That seems like the logical way to end things. It'd be like one man trying to fight an entire army. Things aren't going to be pretty yet Fast Five just tells you that, "Nah, sometimes Superman lends his powers to other people...and they use those powers to drive cars."<br /><br />That doesn't mean Fast Five isn't entertaining at times. The massive amount of destruction alone is awe inspiring. Fast Five is less about racing cars and more about pulling off one last job while dodging the cops. It's partially a heist film, which is a pleasant surprise. That same chase involving the bank vault is unbelievable, but it's also unbelievably entertaining. You'll lose count of how many cars get totaled or thrown off a bridge during the finale. Fast Five is at its best when metal is scraping against metal and when speeds are well over the speed limit.<br /><br />I almost feel like Fast Five would've been better if it had even less of a story since it's fairly simple and mostly just a front for everyone to drive fast and destroy the streets of whatever town they're in once again anyway. So because a job went bad and because family is the most important thing, a group of incredibly skilled drivers attempt to steal every dime from the biggest crime lord in Rio? It just seemed like seeds were planted in the film to take the franchise in a new direction. Sequels seem like they will be more heist oriented and that could be interesting with cars like this being involved, but Fast Five felt like it fell kind of flat in the long run. Like it was juggling heists, racing, cars, the FBI, appropriate screen time and lines for each returning character in addition to new ones, and throwbacks to characters that weren't even there this time around rather than focusing on a few of those things rather than all of them to make the entire film stronger. That doesn't mean the film won't make a killing because it's guaranteed to, but the film offers cars, hot girls, and a lot of outrageous destruction. People looking for a more well-rounded film will walk away disappointed.<br /><br />After being asked what I thought of the film, I replied, "It was...okay-ish, I guess." That's pretty much the best way to describe Fast Five. It isn't terrible, but it probably isn't worth steep movie ticket prices either. If you're a die-hard fan of the franchise, then you can expect a pretty similar experience. The flashy and unrealistic destruction depicted on screen will probably be what you take away most from it. Fast Five does offer some decent popcorn entertainment. If you can leave your brain at home, it's a pretty wild ride. Otherwise Fast Five feels fairly similar to Transporter 2, which isn't a compliment at all.
pretty darn un realsitic<br /><br />kinda a cowboy movie with cars<br /><br />painfully predictable<br /><br />so un realistic it hurts
By the end of this movie you will be banging your head against the wall.  Here is a breakdown:<br /><br />-Not too many cars and the driving is just stunts, no real driving<br /><br />-The Rock and Vin Diesel fight and.... Vin Diesel wins!?!?<br /><br />-Extremely long and pointless chase scene at the end where the director is just throwing away money crashing a lot of ford explorers in south america because it's cheap<br /><br />-The only good part of this movie watching jordana brewster onscreen, but by the end im sick of everything on the screen.
should've saved my five bucks and rented transformers. what a stupid, stupid movie. i expected stupid, but i really expected a little more entertainment. boring and retarded.
On a serious note I wonder how many viewers caught the irony of the immaculate Christ the Redeemer statue over looking one of the world's largest and worst slums.<br />Anyway, the removing of cars from a train scene was entertaining even if not believable whether it was the quick plasma cutting or the 60mph speeding on a dirt trail with holes that would tear a suspension apart even at 5mph while not being torqued in a variety of directions. Yeah, right.<br />Also, falling into water from that height (jumping from the car makes zero difference - same velocity) into water is like falling on to concrete. They also forgot the air bubbles, debris and oil bubbling up from the car.<br />Also, the towing a massive several ton safe around at high speed was entertaining but about as believable as large headed green aliens.<br />The rest of the storyline and wooden stereotypic acting was a rehashed rerun of the genre. Very sleepy-boring.<br /><br />For well acted creative storyline I recommend watching KickAss, Sucker Punch or Hanna again, instead.
Spoiler!<br /><br />So just like in any other fast and the furious movies they have stunts and what not that you know a car wouldn't hold up, and wouldn't be drivable after it happen. But the were on the border line believable which made it awesome. Just did some of that movie magic stuff just like in any other movie. In this furious movie it was different. it was good from the start wasn't great just good. Had the normal stunts type stuff cool story line, and seem to have a twist to it different from the other movies, but then there was the last seen. The last stunt. It just totally ruined the whole movie or me.<br /><br />In the movie the say it's a 10 ton safe or some outrageous number. That's 20,000lbs. Also it's concreted into the wall of a building so it might as well be 100 tons. A peterbuilt semi might be able to get it to move, maybe just maybe, but 2 dodge chargers with hemis are not even going to budge it. I doubt the differential would even hold up, also you would need something a lot heavier then a 2 ton car, a couple of muscle cars doesn't even come close to having enough torque/horsepower/weight to move it. No matter what engine mods you did to it, even if they were four wheel drive it still wouldn't have enough grip, power, strength to move it. A dodge truck with the 5.9 cummins in it wouldn't even have enough, and that makes more torque then the chargers could ever even think about.<br /><br />I understood it was a movie also the other movie had "fake" stuff in it just like any movie does, but they made it seem like it could possibly happen, but when they had those 10 ton safes were whipping around on the road like they were ten cans that was just stupid. Defies all laws of physics period. I probably won't even buy the movie even though I own all the other ones.<br /><br />Now saying the stunt could happen. Say they did pull the safes out of the wall with a couple of dodge chargers.<br /><br />For anyone who has towed anything that weighs more then what the vehicle towing it weighs. The trailer normally ends up controlling your car and you not controlling your vehicle. It'll pull you all over the road and everything else. Unless you just got like five miles an hour to your destination. Now these cars are just whipping these 20 ton safes around like they are tin cans, and it doesn't even come close to pulling their car in a direction they don't want it to.<br /><br />The whole thing was just bogus and ruined the whole fast and the furious movie for me...<br /><br />Now if you can get over the fact of simple physics, and don't look too much into that then you would probably like the movie.
One of the worst movies i've seen in years. I wish I could have the time spent being bored by it, returned to my life. Definitely Vin Diesel's worst ever. Don't spend any pesos on this piece of crap.
I was very disappointed with this DVD. I was very excited to watch the Fast Five but when I opened it nothing was on the disc it was blank. So very disappointed!
I'm glad I only paid 99 cents for this disaster. The only reason I finished it was to see if it would get worse. It did. Anyone over the age of 12 who gave this movie more than two stars needs to finish middle school and high school or get their G.E.D.
**spoiler alert.<br /><br />I wanted to like this, but once again a stupid ending ruined an otherwise ok movie. I was even enjoying it a bit and began to think maybe this will be better than 2 through 4, but in the end when they completely defy the laws of physics and have to cars--that might weigh 3000lbs each--that have a combined HP of maybe 1000hp (if tuned) and have a two inch x ten inch tire patch (times four driving tires) pulling a safe that has to be half a million pounds that was built into a building. Not only do they pull it, somehow their mass is enough to whip it like a water skier behind them and smash it through buildings all while going maybe sixty or seventy mph though a city. There is zero chance any two cars in history could have moved that thing an inch...come on people. Really, I know it's just a movie but this is just stupid.<br /><br />Just stupid.
I was perorder the combo packaging, because i like the firm Fast Five. but the Bluray disc sfter enter playmovie was no sounds. I don't want just because $20 than spen my time to return, but this was made me mad.
After watching this movie and seeing the reviews posted here, I hope for the sake of our country that the studios are paying people to post 5 star reviews. This is the worst movie I have seen in decades. I would go through everything that I found jaw dropping stupid about this movie but I need to begin my healing process and try and forget.
I preordered this movie on sept 24, they said i won't get it until oct 12. Thats to long, should've went to walmart.
i haven't seen this movie  but i guarantee it doesn't deserve  a 4 and a half rating so just on that i give it 1 out of 5
** MINOR PLOT SYNOPSIS (MINUS ENDING)**<br /><br />Vin Diesel is busted out of prison and is reunited with his sister Jordana Brewster (who I fell in love with in D.E.B.S.) and her bf Paul Walker in Rio, the most recognized skyline in the world. They are bad guys stealing cars off a train. As things turned out, these were cars seized by the Brazilian DEA, who for some reason unlike their American counterparts don't disable the vehicles. Due to infighting, the effort is partially botched and Vin Diesel and Walker end up as captives of a Rio mobster. They discover he wants one of the cars back real bad. After they escape they dismantle the car to find out way.<br /><br />Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson comes down from the US to take back Vin Diesel. It seems the US has jurisdiction in Brazil, but hey its a movie. From a chip in the vehicle, Vin Diesel discovers that the crime boss has money stored in various cash houses throughout the city. Walker and Vin Diesel assemble a Mission Impossible team to go after the cash. They attack the first cash house and burn the money which forces the mobster to relocate all his eggs into one basket. As it turns out, that basket is inside the evidence safe at the police station, making the task of that one last hit a bit more difficult. At this point the movie takes a few interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />The plot contains numerous implausibilities as does most Mission Impossible action movies, vehicles that can bust through concrete walls (that never use rebar), and don't even scratch the head lights. The ending will keep Myth Busters busy for a season.
**1/2<br /><br />"Fast Five," so named because it is the fifth entry in the highly lucrative "Fast and Furious" franchise, finds our intrepid band of car-racing criminals, played by Vin Diesel , Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, masterminding a heist against a South American crime lord played by Joaquim de Almeida .  Wayne Johnson joins the cast as an American Secret Service agent hot on the trio's trail.<br /><br />Replete with wafer-thin characters, corny one-liners, substandard acting and muddled moral messaging, the movie culminates in a spectacular, though really rather ludicrous, car chase through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.  Strictly for aficionados of vroom-vroom storytelling.
I have a real `love/hate' relationship with `The Fast and Furious' franchise.  I absolutely loved the original when I was like fifteen and still consider it one of the best films in its genre (thus, my five star review).  `2 Fast 2 Furious' was a tad overblown and nowhere near as fun without Vin Diesel.  Still, it had some great moments and I like it.  `Tokyo Drift' made no sense whatsoever and had none of the original cast, so it seemed wholly unnecessary and yet it was far more entertaining than the initial sequel and had a great star making turn (if you call this a `star making vehicle') by Lucas Black, so it was forgivable and certainly enjoyable.  `Fast & Furious' was cheap and ridiculous and a gross underachievement and a major disappointment.  It had almost no merit whatsoever.  After that bitter pill, I was ready to write off `Fast Five' before it was even released.  I mean, as much as I loved the original, do we really need five `Fast and Furious' movies (six now that the sixth film has been greenlit)?<br /><br />Alas, I gave in to temptation (much like I did with that terrible `Transformers' movie) and found out that my expectations were surpassed, in a really good way.<br /><br />The worst thing I can say about `Fast Five' is that it is too long.  The film itself is probably the best in the series, maybe even better than the original, but it needed to be edited slightly.  The ending just drags out, and it doesn't have the level of polish needed to justify an elongated story.  It is similar to 2006's `Casino Royale' in the way that it is expanded storywise, but `Casino Royale' justified it's extensions with sharp development.  `Fast Five' can't do that, because this story lacks the depth it wants to have.  It is fun, but it isn't particularly smart.<br /><br />That said; every other element works really well here.  Having nearly every member from the original and sequels come together for this really big heist in Rio was pretty cool and helped aid in the nostalgic feel (it made me want to rewatch the original) and other aspects of the film really soar, like the crisp cinematography and the visual effects (that train sequence was FLAWLESS).  The acting is decent, Paul Walker still as wooden as ever, but this is Diesel's wheelhouse and so he does what he does better than The Rock.  Seriously, it's a shame that The Rock stole Vin Diesel's career.  It's funny to see them opposite each other.  They are basically the same person and yet Diesel's career, which seemed so promises, has pretty much dissolved and The Rock has arguably received every role Diesel could have and should have gotten.<br /><br />It's fun and exciting and bold and sets us up for the third (sixth) installment that Diesel promises is going to be amazing.  I can't really see how they can take this any further since all five films so far have pretty much consisted of the SAME THING, but this one places all those elements in the best possible order.
Of course you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy the films that make up the Fast & Furious franchise. The first four made for an exhilirating theatrical ride. The 5th installment was just too ridiculous even for the most vivid of imaginations. The gang of loveable lawbreakers were pretty much transformed into a squadron of super heroes who can take on any army...in this case, the Rio Police Department. The movie trailer has already shown us parts of the infamous action sequence where Diesel and Walker drive off a cliff, manage to seperate themselves from the car in mid air, and land unscathed in a lake (there should've been a pair shark fins protruding from the water, if ya' catch my drift.) I won't spoil the ending, but since when were those fast little cars known for their towing capabilities? Although the film makers went over the top this time, the rating doesn't deserve anything below 3 stars. The stunts and CGI were exciting, and you got to respect the stunt men and women who are risking life and limb to entertain us. It was nice to see Tyrese, Ludacris, and Jordana Brewster come back, and Dwayne Johnson was a great addition.
Ordered this DVD for my husbands birthday. The movie is great! Fast cars, great action and a good cast. Got this from Amazon as they can always get it for me at a few dollars less than I would have to pay in a store.
Let me preface this review by saying that if you are a fan of the Fast and Furious movies strictly for the cars and the racing, you may not share my pure love for this movie. There is very little racing, and one scene of drifting. Fast Five is my favorite of the movies because it had plot beyond racing. It had the best characters from the four previous movies (even Tokyo Drift) and it incorporated a heist. I love a good heist. The chase scene at the end of the movie is awesome, in my opinion. A lot of stunts were unbelievable, but it's a movie, so there should be shock value. Watch the scene after the credits because there will be a Fast Six. This movie is one of the best action movies of 2011.
Don't get me wrong, I love the Fast and Furious trilogy, and I understand that the movie has what we call in Brazil: "the artistic right" to show things a bit different for the sake of a better result, but when you see the movie, please consider:<br /><br />- Rio Police cars are not Mustangs, Camaros or anything closer...these cars are way, way, way too much expensive in Brazil than they are in US, therefore you need to have some good cash to afford having one of those.<br /><br />- Yes, there is a lot of corruption in Rio Police, and the idea of a safe like the one depicted by the movie would only be feasible if it was sponsored by that guy...no, I'm not going to tell it...see the movie ^^. But anyway, it was a nice catch: I would never think about it...<br /><br />- If a "gringo" go to a favela and shows a handgun like that (well, first of all, he would never be able to get there the way he did...), no matter how big it is (the gringo and the gun)...he will LOSE it there...and get killed, of course (not necessarily in this sequence). So kids, don't try it there, OK?!<br /><br />Well, I've got a lot of fun watching the movie for the action, and laughed a lot remembering the scenes and writing down this review. It it great fun for everybody though.
Ever wondered whether a meeting between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock would eclipse a meeting between Stallone / Schwarzenegger / Willis?<br /><br />Wonder no more - Fast and Furious 5 conclusively ends that debate. This is an epic movie, original, creative action right from start of the movie to the end. Not only action is superb, the acting is good too. A movie with equal amount of action and heart. Paul Walker adds to the mix with his great acting as well.<br /><br />The thing I like about his movie is there is virtually no gimmick. Just an excellent chemistry between a whole bunch of actors, mindblowing action and great storyline. I've never seen such action scenes before... epic!<br /><br />I watched this without any idea what I was expecting, and I was simply blown away. Get this, you won't regret it.
great movie, exactly how it was in theaters. This is probably one of the best Fast/Furious movies in the entire series.
First of all, I love this series of movies, ever since the first one, but this one, oh wow! It is soooo awesome! I'm now rating this one as one of my top five favorite movies of all time. This movie is freaking awesome and it makes me drool. For one the cars, my dream car is a Nissan GTR, but one that is a little more affordable is the 2011 Dodge Charger and seeing them as police cars and also the 2012 Dodge Charger SRT-8's. I could believe it, they were awesome!<br />Now I haven't gone through all the blu-ray, but the extended edition I saw no extras scenes or notice any new parts, that I hadn't seen at the theater. If you wanted an extended edition, go get the Lord of the Rings extended editions, those were awesome, to me the longer the movie the better.<br />I am still definitely happy with the blu-ray, the movie looks great plus my fiancee can have the dvd, and with all my digital copies, I though about just putting them on my laptop and if I want to watch them on there some time I could.<br /><br />All in all the movie is great, the blu-ray is great, can't be happier!
We thoroughly enjoyed this and consider it to be the best in this series of movies, so far. Highly entertaining, especially the final chase scene!
best of all fast & furious movies, awesome action scenes (the bridge, the safe, and the fight scenes)<br />hope this anit the last one... i want more!!!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056BU3I2">Fast Five (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy in Blu-ray Packaging)</a>
The title for this ongoing sequel to Fast and Furious is, it seems, related to the number of films based on this fast driving bunch of car fanatics than to the number of people in the tribe. What makes this series of Pow and Wow action flicks stand above many of its competitors is the tremendous sense of fun the cast seems to be having - leaping over rooftops, driving fast cars, pulling off impossible heists. It all ends in a sense of fun and introduces the teaser for the next in the series (a bit with Eva Mendes and Jason Mignot in a brief talk after the credits run pretty much guarantees the next installment).<br /><br />This time the guys and girls - Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), her boyfriend ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Vince (Matt Schulze), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han Lue (Sung Kang), Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot) Tego Leo (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) - gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - each in various stages of running from the past - hunted by FBI Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and in desperate need for money to escape Rio to countries where they cannot be extradited. They discover the one last job opportunity - taking away the money that billionaire Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) takes from the money houses in the infamous Rio favelas district.  It takes the talent of the entire crew to make the heist of heists as the safe where the illegal money is kept is in the police station in a huge vault that is impenetrable - until our gang takes over in likely the most interesting and entertaining chase scene on film.  The rest of the story is fluff but nice - with a little love interest thrown in for good measure.  This cast is strong and they pull of the fine line between comedy and drama very well.  In the end this is a fast and entertaining escape film. And #6  will probably come soon!  Grady Harp, October 11
has to be the best in the series so far. the rock was an excellent addition to the crew the fight between him and Vin was terrific. had a nice way of bringing together all the movies in the series by bringing in memorable charters from all the movies. a must have for any fan of the series. cant wait for the next one
Okay, I'm a HUGE fan of Vin's and always enjoy watching his movies, over and over again.  I eagerly anticipated Fast Five.  When it came out I went to see it (several times) and I don't recommend seeing it on the Big Screen, it just got to close.  That being said this movie had action and lots of it.  I loved it!  With each movie in this series the only thing negative I can say about them is that it was a mistake to not have Vin in all of them.  Of course Vin rocks as an actor and he just keeps getting better and better.<br />A couple of the reviews talk about how it wasn't possible for the two cars to pull that safe through a wall.  Guys, it's the movies.  That's why it's the movies.  You know, to bring fantasy to the big screen.  Can't you just enjoy seeing something for the fun of seeing it done?  Who cares if it could happen in real life or not.  Heck, is it something you plan on doing?  Anyway, watching these muscle-bound guys in awesome muscle cars was great!  Justin Lin is an impressive director.  I'll have to watch more of his stuff.  Brian O'Conner, Tego Calder&oacute;n and Don Omar are becoming fast favorites of mine.  You want to know the best part though?  If you stayed through the credits, I would never leave my Vin until the projector stops running, I think Letty, aka Michelle Rodriguez is coming BACK!!!!!!  Can't wait.  I hope it's not a long wait for the next one.  So all in all based on plot, action etc.: The Fast and the Furious-5 stars, 2 Fast 2 Furious-3 stars cause Vin ain't in it, Fast and Furious-5 stars, Tokyo Drift-3 stars, at least we got to see Vin for sec, Fast Five-5 stars. Go see it, better yet buy the video.  You'll want to watch it several times.  LUST YOU, UMMM, LOVE YOU VIN!!!!!
Fast Five is a return to form of the franchise which began 10 years ago in 2011. After several attempts to recreate the original magic (including Fast And Furious from 2009 which featured both Paul Walker and Vin Diesel) which didn't quite satisfy, Fast Five not only brings back most key characters from all the previous films (thankfully sans Lucas Black from Tokyo Drift), but manages to become the most action-packed and fun film in the saga, and begins a new chapter in what hopefully will be more films to follow.<br /><br />The characters have evolved so much since the original, and it is quite a bit of fun to see. Add to the mix Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as an DSS agent, and you get to see a brawl that action stars have been drooling over for years.<br /><br />This is a no-brainer for your movie collection, if you have ever enjoyed the F & F films, or are an action-movie junkie. The best in the series, hands down.
I rarely ever do a review on here of anything. Even though I have bought numourous things off of Amazon I rarely ever do a review. But after seeing Fast Five I feel like I need to tell the world how good it is. But if action movies aren't your thing and your more of a Black Swan or Benjamin Button type of person this ain't for you. But if you like good unbeliveable action movies that keep you on the edge of your seat than this is for you. Vin Diesel and crew really out did themselves with this one and one can only imagine what part 6 will be like. Yes the action is unrealistic and would never ever happen in real life without them dying but that's the fun of these movies. You see stuff you wouldn't normally see in real life like two guys driving a car off a cliff into the water. Or someone dragging a safe full of money down the freeway knocking over cars in the process. Or shootouts over roof tops in Rio. Besides the action in this movie I like the characters in this one or character, The Rock. They finally introduce someone how can take on Vin Diesel and make it believable. When Rock is off camara you want him back and when he's back he is on point. Rock should get his own spinoff or something after this and it's nice to see him back in a action movie. Rock and Vin Diesel go at it in their fight scene which I hope there is more of in part 6. The other characters are from the previous movies like Ludacris, Tyrese & others. They are brought back to help Paul Walker and Vin Diesel pull off a heist against a man who tried to have them killed in the beginning. It's nice to see the characters from 2 Fast reunited and even those from Tokyo Drift. There isn't much street racing and I think that was a good choice. I think that it was a good ideal for them to drop the whole street race angle because it was getting played out and refresh the franchise with the whole heist job thing. Although they should have started it with Fast and Furious because that was sort of a letdown. Speaking of Fast and Furious it's ashame they went and killed off Diesel's girl she would have been good in this. Oh yeah watch after the credits to see the set up for part 6 if someone hasn't already told you about it or you' ve already watched it on Youtube.
Despite the fact I'm hating how far a franchise goes in terms of how they prolong a storyline, I loved this movie.  The end scene after the credits points a fast and furious six which there already commercials for.  The beginning scene was very intense and greatly captured.  I recommend this to all Fast and Furious fans.  It may be a prolonged storyline, but this one is worth it!!
I ordered the movie got it home and it worked just fine. Anyone that loves the Fast movies should get this!
At first, I was not sure if FAST FIVE would be worth my time but after watching it; I wanted more.  There is plenty of action from the sick driving scenes to the hardcore fights free-for-all.  From the beginning to the end this movie does keep you on your seats waiting for the next plot turn.  The Rock, to me, stole the show.  His kick-ass take no prisoners until the job is done mentally is GREAT.  The ending after the credits is a must see and leaves you with more questions than answers.  This movie is a great pick for a rental or too own you can't go wrong with either decision.
This is one of my favorites and this was the last one of the set I have been purchasing.  Great movie with the originals from the earlier movies.
Movie was absolutely good. But I was very disappointed to find out it was a rental and it did not permit me enjoy the extras (features or bonus). I will surely read betternext time. I felt cheated.
Fun movie to watch I have the hole set of moive they are fun to watch for hours an hours of car racing. Great movie.
Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.<br /><br />Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of "Desperado" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.<br /><br />What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.<br /><br />Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious "Danza Kuduro" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.<br /><br />There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.<br /><br />The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.<br /><br />That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.<br /><br />Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.<br /><br />Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.<br /><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Steelbook Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.
Fast and Furious Five has everything I could have hoped for. Lots and lots of sweet, beautiful action; clever plot; amazing set of actors; sweet ending; good movie length (it isn't short which is a big win); totally exciting. This is the movie that I will watch again, this is the movie that is a must for my collection. I can't wait for Fast and Furious 6. In my opinion this is the best of all Fast & Furious movies. Fast Five definitely has a shot at Best Picture. Amazing movie. I had no idea, Fast Five would be so awesome! Fast Five deserves every single dollar it has earned! There are so many new movies that aren't nearly as good as this one. Amazing.
GREAT CONDITION! GOT IT FAST AND NO PROBLEMS! THANKS SO MUCH! I love Amazon SHOPPING! get FAST FIVE NOW! my collection is complete till 6 comes out! haha
The movie was excellent thats really the reason I bought it.  However it did not come with its original case which I really hated.  I collect movies and without the case it was pointless buying it from this buyer.
This review is just about the Blu-ray disc itself. For me this is an excruciating poor BD to navigate.<br />I have an older Panasonic BD30 player, and I realize that that might make things extra slow for me.<br />But this disc is slow to load and as happens on Blu-ray Discs at their worst, I pay a steep penalty for watching a feature on the extras menu - at the end of every feature I have to wait what seems like a really long time for the disc to return me the the previous menu. Also, pausing the disc too long puts me into some sort of Universal wallpaper that offers no clue as to how to get back to where I was. It was trial and error to find a remote sequence that worked, and in one case I just had to power down/power up the player to get off this screen. Super annoying, and I know this can be part of BDs in general bit this disc is as bad as I've seen in that regard.<br />There is a lot of interesting extra content to watch, but the super-annoying BD process wastes a lot of time in between them. Sometimes I like to browse these or skim them to see if they are interesting to me. Or if I'm short on time, power watch the extras. But there's no way to get through these fast and that's BD at its most annoying.
Okay, I love racing movies, especially the Fast and Furious movies with their constant racing, girls, and girls. Yeah, I said it. Anyways, I've always been a fan of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. They are both great actors, along with making the movie a bit more exciting with their, on and off relation ship of deciding weather he was a part of the family or not. This movie, had so much actions, I actually sat through the whole thing, and ate my popcorn. I recommend it, watch it now! D:
This is best Fast and the Furious that has been made to date because it has all of the favorites for the original-The Fast and the Furious & 2 Fast 2 Furious not the mention all the others in between. Fast Five has all the actors that you loved from the privious ones into one movie. Add it to your collection.
Wow!  This movie has it all..great cast and great story...with a special treat - "The Rock"!  A great "good bad guys" movie!  The only time you are on the side of the thieves...
Not really being a fan of action films and only watching the third Fast/Furious movie, I wasn't too stoked about watching this in theaters (Big mistake) and instead only rented it recently, WOW!<br /><br />The film just opens up with cars racing and busting Vin Diesel out of prison in the most unrealistic way possible, and leads to the characters hiding out in Rio evading the FBI and the army in Rio who are all after the main characters. It's like one big action scene after another, with little intervals of the guys snorting testosterone and yelling at each other to keep the plot moving along. Fast Five ain't no Citizen Kane that's for sure, but for an action film it's perfection. The characters all have good chemistry together, the Rock (or is it Dwayne now?) makes a good rival to Vin Diesel and every action scene was creative and not something I've normally seen before, especially the final chase scene.<br /><br />Chances are you've probably already seen this, but Fast Five is one damn good action flick coming from someone who's not usually a fan of action films.
This is the best fast and furious movie by far! Awesome stunts, great acting, and plenty of star power, and with number six approching the star power seems to be growing. If your a fan don't miss this one, you will be kicking yourself if you do.
Great movie with lots of action. The latest in the Fast and Furious series. Loved fight scenes with the "Rock" and Vin Diesel. Great driving scenes.
Flat out, the best action and stunt sequences of 2011. Anyone who's unconvinced that this type of movie making isn't its own art form needs to watch closer. I've never been a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but this movie won me over and then some. Sure, the dialogue's a bit hokey and the acting not exactly Oscar worthy, but that's not the point here. Those stunt sequences, especially the crazy chase that ends the film, are absolutely breathtaking.
The fast and the furious franchise has evolved, but some things stay the same: great racing/car scenes, interesting characters, ridiculous story lines, and some good action. With Fast Five, it has pushed the series to a whole new level, involving Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, a heist plot, and lots and lots of explosions.<br /><br />During trailers, the showdown between Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Vin Diesel was hyped up and created a tantalizing matchup. The showdown lived up to its hype, as I enjoyed the constant tension, testosterone vs. testosterone. It was a pleasant on screen duo.<br /><br />The one character I've always enjoyed is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson). Admist all of the action and tension, he always manages to provide some comedic relief.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the combination of characters, action, and the entertaining heist. In terms of action, I enjoyed Fast Five the most in this franchise.
I really love these movies(hopefully they'll make a 6 with Michelle(Letty) back).cool,fast cars great actors, just all 'round great movie.
I love that they have pick up on the storyline and really made something great with it. if you like the other before this then you will love this even more. I cant wait to see what is next
The scene with the safe and all the car crashes was absolutely my favorite part. Paul walker and vin diesel really made good actors for this type of movie. Brilliant!
Like I keep repeating, I buy these movies because I love them<br />I've already watched it, 3 times and it's in perfect condition, no bugging or freezing!<br />Thanks
Thanks for sending me an email to review a film I seen 4 months ago! Reviewed on 3/27/12. It was a great movie for what I can remember. Alot of action scenes and stunts! The film was entertaining throughout. The stunts were thought out extremely well and executed perfectly. I recommend this film
In regards to the radical driving off a huge cliff scene.  I recently learned that it was popular for men to try to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge when it was first constructed. Survival from this jump was pretty dicey. Some guys made it and some didn't. The first guy to try it died when he hit the water 135 feet below. Others were knocked unconscious and had to be saved by boats in the water. One guy claimed to do it without anyone seeing him and then opened up a successful restaurant based on the fact that he jumped. So really with falls of that height it is going to be pretty much up to the individual.<br /><br />With a 200 foot fall the likelihood of survival becomes even less but that's when you have to factor in who is falling in this movie. You're talking about Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Obviously they can handle it. Vin Diesel is a guy that can jump a motorcycle 40 feet into the air without even trying. Paul Walker is a determined man that won't let countless obstacles stop him from finding his dogs, you think a two hundred foot fall is going to stop him? Come on get serious.<br /><br />look for my full review at<br />[..]
This is a fun movie to watch - lots of action, really sweet fast cars, very hot women (But there's one that's a little too skin and bones for me...) but several are very HOT... - I've seen all 5 of the fast and furious movies and this is the best of the 5, the first is very good also.  Some of the stunts were obviously very dangerous and I was like no way they'd be dead (over and over again) - sometimes my prior physics/engineering training keeps me from really enjoying a movie because I can see how unrealistic they are ...  but it's fun and some of the scenes are just classic ..  it's a little slow at times and lost my attention - so that's why I'm giving this 3 stars because if it could keep me glued then it would get more - and it isn't getting more because it isn't realistic enough to hold my attention all the way but honestly it's a very fun movie to watch - enjoy
This is one of the best in the series.  I think the original, tokyo drift were all great too.  bought this when it was on sale and for what its worth, its a great package being that it comes with Bluray/DVD.<br /><br />Story was well written, I think its more action than it is talking.  Some parts were slow, but, overall it was enough to keep me interested.  You kind of expect certain events to play out and know the outcome.<br /><br />Some cool stunts pulled off in this movie and although in real life this is impossible, but, still its overall entertaining.
It was good movie with a lot of car chases, fight scenes and good story line.  However, it was pretty predictable how it was going to end.
Of course this is an excellent movie.  Very happy with the price and the packaging.  Item came as described and packed well.
I have been a fan of the Fast and Furious since the beginning.  They lost their way on Tokyo Drift so I am glad to see redemption with this movie.  Great cast, it is the best of the best!  Action is amazing and the fight scene between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson is one of the best I have ever seen!  This movie is great eye candy for the ladies and all the action for the men!
A very good action movie... good cars and effects!!! The extended part I never see it, but the movie it's good!!!
great movie this movie tied all the other movies together to make it all make sence truly well done. I dont usually like movies that have more than one or two sequals before they get just much to rediculous ...not the case here .
You can't get a better combo of hot muscle and fast cars.  Diesel & Johnson were made to do movies together!
well worth the cash... loved it in theaters and just had to buy the blu-ray. i cant wait for the sequals.
Fast Five reunion - everyone from the first movie is back. Dwayne Johnson was a great addition. Awesome chase scene!
This movie is great! The director is a keeper, he knows the right feel for this franchise. I hope they don't change because they have a Hot item here and I don't think anyone else out there will get it right.
good movie.worth every penny.lots of action with the whole crew of every fast and the furious.must see.quick and fast shipping,plus shipped nicely.
This movie is great if your a fan of cars or just a heist movie. The movie is worth the money if only to see Vin Diesel and The Rock in a full blown gorilla fight.
This was a good fast and furious movie. You should watch it. We thought it was one of the better ones in the series
This is not a review of the movie. There are enough reviews already on Amazon to decide if you would like to see the actual movie or not. This is a review on the "Extended Version" of this movie. You would have to pay close attention to see where the movie was actually extended. It adds a few frames and  has slight differences that cause the movie to be about 70 seconds longer than the original and only slightly different in some scenes (different angles, etc.). This website shows the differences for each scene---- www (dot) movie-censorship (dot)com/report (dot) php?ID=149783 . It seems to me that the extended version doesn't add much that theatrical version doesn't already have and what is added doesn't seem to make it better.
When I saw the movie at the theater, I knew I had to buy it. It's amazing, totally recommend it.
I really encouraged people back in the summer of 2011 to see Fast Five on the big screen.  This was a movie made for the movie theaters with larger-than-life action and characters (Diesel's Dominic Toretto and Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson's Luke Hobbs).  It was a dizzying and jazzy and thrilling mash-up of the previous Fast/ Furious movies with a painted overcoat of the Ocean's 11 franchise.  More of an action heist movie than a race-the-mean-streets gig Fast Five lets the viewer in on the fun that the actors and producers were obviously having while making the movie; by the time the gang gives up on the original heist plan we have given up too, believing that they just can't pull it off, and so we readily jump into the absurdity and audacity that follows as two cars and some sort of super-cable manage to yank a vault the size of a large bathroom out of a police station and then rumble it demolition-ball style throughout the streets of Rio de Janiero!  Did I mention absurdity and audacity yet?  This was one of my favorite, if not my favorite, movie moments of 2011.  It was gonzo and they went for it.  I knew after seeing this one on the big screen that it would lose something in its transfer to our television screens and it sure did (I would have given it 5 stars for the big screen); seeing it in such a greatly reduced scope and for a second time simply reduced the thrill.<br /><br />But this movie still entertains madly!  From the King Kong versus Godzilla duel that the battle between Vin Diesel and the Rock suggests (and delivers!) (BTW, have you ever seen a movie where you thought, "Man, I'd like to see those two go head-to-head", and they didn't and you were disappointed?  I'm looking at you "War"; Jason Statham and Jet Li starring together in a movie and not fighting!?!) to the planning of a ridiculous heist stealing money out of a police station to the ripping cars off from a moving train this movie has moments that make you go, "No way they just did that or are going to try that!"  But yes they did and yes they are.<br /><br />Oh, and did anyone else wonder, as my wife did, if the Rock felt pain when he stood in those chest-and-legs-out poses?  Me, I wondered how he got his arms to that ungodly massive size!
I was not a fan of the Furious Five series.I thought it was another car movie and I did not want to see it. It since this went on sale I decided to get it and see what it was all about.I was shocked that it was not about a race and I can honestly say I really am glad and I can honestly say I am going to go back and watch these others. You should see it.
This was complete and utter escapist fantasy!<br /><br />It didn't matter that parts of the plot were completely unbelievable.  It didn't even matter that there were no captions.<br /><br />The parts of the scenery that featured the ocean and the countryside surrounding Rio were breathtaking!  Made me totally want to visit and see the ocean.  Guess that's going on my bucket list.  lol<br /><br />I admit being shallow enough to *totally* enjoy the fight between Johnson and Diesel.  I'm sure it was choreographed all to hell, and yet it looked like they were having so much fun with each other.<br /><br />Yes, I finished high school.  Yes, I'm older than twelve.  Yes, I'm even a girl.  Yes, I just adored this movie.  Not everything has to be a high-brow cinematic masterpiece.
This movie fast five is my favortie out of the series. All of the movies are good. The action crazy cool. If you like fast car and hot girls. He movie is for u
Paul Walker is fantastic!! I love him he's so hot! By far it was the best movie of the Fast and Furious series.
Great action movie! Scored it for a super good price. Came in three days earlier than expected. It's one of the few movies that I don't mind watching over and over.
Another great movie! The Rock was great in this one. The only disappointment was the ending. My grandson loves the movie!
Item came in quick and in good condition. This is a very good movie, worthy to be in par with the other fast and furious movies. Hard hitting and action packed.
Well what can I say??....excellent!!5 Start for this movie.A good convination to make the best movie in this time .
Nice!! This movie was wonderful finale to the Fast and Furious franchise. It had the potential to be an over-kill with all the players from the other films, but it worked out and remained true to the franchise's conception.
The item came on time and there were no issues with the dvd or its cover. It was very reasonablly priced and my best friend was very excited to receive it.
DVD arrived very fast. We actually had the DVD in time for Christmas and when I placed the order very late and didn't expect it to arrive that quickly.
Without  The Rock  then i would never buy this movie DVD. The Rock is number one action star of Hollywood so others are number two/2nd in this movie.<br />Best of  FAST...MOVIES.
I purchased this video for my son as a Christmas gift, as I knew he wanted it. He had seen it in the theaters when it was first released and raved about it to me. We watched it the day after Christmas and I was as impressed with the action and plot as he was. The dynamic between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson is great, and the special effects and stunts are amazing.
We truly like our movie. It arrived on time, and was in excellent condition. We would definetly deal with this again.
Fast Five is the latest in the action-driven, visually stunning, Fast and the Furious series. I would think it's the last installment, but these days I suppose anything is possible. It begins with brother and sister Dom and Mia Toretto (Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster) along with ex-law enforcement officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) as wanted fugitives on the move and in need of gainful, thought not legal, employment. Once they find a job and prove unsuccessful in performing it, they are now sought by a drug kingpin and faux philanthropist who contracted them in the first place.<br /><br />  Rather than knuckle under or retreat, the trio decides to bankrupt their unscrupulous foe, and thereby render him powerless. For this they need help and that is the reason they bring any living associates they from the previous films that played a significant role. All the while their nemesis has informed the American authorities as to their location in an effort to spoil their plans. Enter The Rock, playing U.S. Marshal Luke Hobbs, with the unflinching assistance of the Rio police, who are paid agents of the aforementioned kingpin. In addition, Hobbs has a very rigid view of his responsibility for the larger portion of the film.<br /><br />  Fast Five isn't anything its predecessors weren't. Save for a little misdirection at the end. It's about beautiful cars, beautiful women, and the occasional fistfight or shootout. In that regard it's a success.
This movie is awesome. Reuniting all the main characters from the franchise was a good idea. The action sequence is unbelievable
Slow to get going but after that.... lots of bullets, fast cars, screaming tires, car chases, explosions, car crashes. Hardly need the sound to be on as dialogue is nothing to write home about but was dialogue even expected??? For what it is, it was fine.
If you like the Fast Five movies, you are REALLY going to like this one! If you like action and/or thriller movies, this is for you - check it out!
This is one of the best action movies of 2011. In the local retail store, the digital + blu ray copies were about $22, i was able to find it online for much less.
Saw this movie 4 times in theaters, pre-ordered on first available day!  I've already watched it a dozen times at home...LOVE IT!  The extended version isn't great, it's only 60 seconds longer than the theater version.  Love the extras too.
My husband and I have enjoyed all the movies in the Fast & Furious series, but this one might just be our favorite. Timeline-wise, it falls after Fast & Furious (#4) but before Tokyo Drift (#3). In my opinion, it revived the series in a fun way and makes me look forward to more in the series. The stunts (while perhaps far-fetched) were done very believable, with little CGI, making the viewing experience very enjoyable. The storyline didn't bore you, and watching Vin Diesel fight the Rock was just plain fun! If you're not a fan of the other movies, you probably won't like this one. However, some friends of our had never seen any of them and watched this with us and now want to watch the whole series.
