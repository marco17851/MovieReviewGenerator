It's high time this fabulous film of Salome became available on DVD and I'm ordering it as soon as it's available on July 7th.  It's like diving into a feast of depravity.  Teresa Stratas, who would never have been able to undertake this great role in a staged production in one evening, nevertheless creates a filmed Salome that is pretty close to the absolute ideal.  Beautiful, sexy, and catlike, she brings the depraved Princess of Judea to life as no other.  As noted earlier, she lacked the sheer vocal power to bring this opera to life in the theatre, but in a film, with microphones, she comes across with aces to spare.  While she pretty much is the whole show, Astrid Varnay, herself a great artist, comes across as a beast-gorgon Herodias, whose own youthful sexual depravity now shows only in her distorted reptile-like face.  Her voice is in tatters, but it matters little in a role like this.  Her contribution to the success of this project is immeasurable.  The color is vivid, the location shots realistic ------ and if I'm rambling on about this, it's only because it's all so scary and fun.  Bohm was the greatest Strauss conductor of his time, and he brings the shattering music to the fore as only he could.  Buy it!!!!!!!!!
Whether this is your first experience with Salome or if you are already a dyed-in-the-wool Strauss fan, this Salome is for you!<br />Why?  As other reviews have mentioned, Teresa Stratas is beautiful and perfect for the role, and she remains totally involved in the action through the entire opera.<br /><br />Also, Astrid Varnay is the quintessential Herodias, a "painted queen" who is desperately clinging to her control over her husband and will use anything--even her own daughter to manipulate the man.  Her diabolical laughter resounds as pure evil.<br /><br />Karl Bohm is the greatest Strauss conductor, and he shows it here, letting Strauss' chords rise just as powerfully as the composer would wish.  Bernd Weikl's strong voice of a prophet is perfect for the role of Jochanaan, and his looks complement the descriptions that Salome makes of him.<br /><br />But what really makes this Salome a "must" for you, is that this great one-act opera was produced as a film.  This allows the camera to go in close on the players in this psychologically tormenting story.  It actually helps us understand the interplay of all the characters as the camera watches their reaction to each other. Recordings, or even  live on-stage performances do not allow you to watch some of the reactions that are so important in a psychological drama such as this.<br /><br />Money was not spared in the costuming and staging, which let you feel as if you're looking right at the Judea of Herod's time.<br /><br />The director (Gotz Friedrich) has also frequently placed Salome and her mother side-by-side, so that we can compare their reactions to Herod.  It is a lesson in acting, to watch Herodias (Astrid Varnay) in her reactions to each sequence of Salome's dance.  Even the shocking old queen can be shocked.<br /><br />Yes, the "Dance of the Seven Veils" is perfect, but seeing Stratas lithely and gracefully moving around the stage is certainly just what Strauss intended for his prima donna, whom Herod calls "her mother's child."<br />At the end, we find that Herod, Herodias, and Salome all end up being deliciously repulsive, yet fascinating.
This 1974 film version of Strauss' opera is a dream come true as far as being released on DVD. It is probably the best version there is, with all roles being ideally cast. Stratas will leave you cold - she is great singer and a fantastic actress.
Absolutely smashing! Apart from the great set design by Friedrich it is the casting that makes this production a masterpiece. While many have commented on the obvious excellence of the acting/singing performance of Stratas, I think Weikl makes a great Jochanaan - the voice, the presence, the look. Salome is right to be terrified of him, the references she makes to his pale body, his hair and then his mouth are all perfectly apt.<br />Herod is perfectly decadent while Herodias is a complete wreck of a woman, in essence everything is as it should be. Even Narroboth is spot on - he looks like the typical Roman fool ready to die on his own sword!<br /><br />Stratas's acting is incredible. I have never seen anything like it in opera in fact. I almost wonder if she overdoes it and plays Salome as almost too human where in fact she might be interpreted as being colder, less prone to expressions and feelings of fear than she might outwardly, at times, profess. I think it may be a matter of taste though and I was perfectly happy with this expressive and nuanced performance.<br /><br />This is among my very favourite opera dvds.
I agree with Robert Petersen.  I own the Laserdisc and have been awaiting this release.  The production really captures the ghoulish, erotic neurosis of the opera.  The acting is fabulous; so is the music.  This is the one to get!
ATTENTION 'JUSTOLDBILL' ANKENBROCK -THE DVD 'MAHOGONNY' WITH STRATAS/VARNAY IS AVAILABLE IN THE MET'S JAMES LEVINE DVD PACKAGE: [...] - or may be available on amazon or elsewhere -<br />REVIEW:  As previous reviewers have opined, this is a real sonic and visual treat. I have owned the Lazer Disc for 20 years, and never tire of it. It still looks good on my 56" JVC which converts all signals to 1080, and the digital sound shakes the house: wait for Johannan's retreat to the dungeon, after Salome's lascivious failed seduction - and the gate crashes down......Bernt Weikl is noble and shining, the Dance of the 7 Veils is convincingly danced by the slender and serpentine Stratas, who reveals all in the finale, and the final scene is mesmerizing and shocking.  I have shown it to non-opera aficianados, and they are converted at once. Please somebody let me know if the DVD is video remastered and in widescreen, as this would be reason enough to buy again!
I saw this production on TV many years ago and thought then that it was really good, I have now changed my mind, it is brilliant, although Teresa Stratas probably could not have sung the role on stage she excels here, her acting, dancing and singing is superb, is there any end to this womans talent? the rest of the cast is so well made that this is a masterpiece, the great Astrid Varnay is well cast here, vocally she is well past her prime but her experience in opera makes her the ideal Herodias. I have a number of performances with Stratas including Nedda and Violetta in La Traviata and she never puts a foot wrong no matter what she is doing. If you want Salome this has to be the only way to go. Brilliant, tense, sexy and overall frightening performance from Teresa Stratas, that is exactly what Salome should be. Karl Bohm's control of the orchestra is magnificent, but then this is the great Karl Bohm so you don't expect anything less.
Why the devil won't DG release this on DVD? Without a doubt the best 'Salome' ever filmed. Casting, acting, direction & sets are all top notch & would be hard to better. There are some minor idiosyncrasies with the dubbing, but this could easily be fixed in the remastering on DVD. So if anyone from DG happens to read this, please take into consideration to my humble plea.
I agree with all the glowingly positive reviews about this DVD.<br /><br />I just want to say that any CD or DVD that Teresa Stratas has recorded is worth studying deeply.  She is an uncompromising artist and a total original.  She was one of the first operas singers to act like an actor and sing like an opera singer.  I know a lot of people talk about acting in opera, but what passed for acting in opera (even a generation ago)was mostly intellectual posing.  Teresa Stratas is the predecessor to Karita Mattila who is a singer-actor of the highest order.<br /><br />Tha name Teresa Stratas is synoymous with great artistry.  Even when she fails she fails gloriously.<br /><br />Astrid Varnay (who sings Herodias on this DVD) praised Stratas and her work on this Salome in her autobiography.
I'm not a fan of opera on film, as I often feel that there's too much of a disconnect between the recorded soundtrack and the singers' actions.  (Basically, most opera singers are lousy lip-synchers.)  But if any DVD were to change my mind, it would be this one, mostly because of the extraordinary performance of a young, stunningly beautiful Teresa Stratas.  Her gradual decline from willful petulance into obsessed insanity is remarkably vivid and harrowing; this is the kind of intense and intelligent acting one expects from a Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett.  Add a voice that's vibrant, clear and passionate and the kind of sexy star-quality you associate with a Sophia Loren and you have what may be the most perfectly calibrated opera performance I've ever seen.<br /><br />With the exception of Bernd Weikl's supremely wild and creepy Jochanaan, the rest of the cast isn't quite up to Ms. Stratas's standards.  Yes, Astrid Varnay is a legendary talent, but I wish she and Hans Beirer weren't directed to be the comic relief.  And they're terrible lip-synchers, so all my reservations about opera on film started to intrude as soon as they came on screen.  Also, I thought that The Dance of the Seven Veils felt flat, with Stratas looking a little too much like Cousin It at the top of it.  But these are minor reservations when stacked against her towering, magnificent performance.  This is the best Salome -- and therefore "Salome" -- that you're ever likely to see.  Ever.  (Can you tell I liked it?)
This must be one of the best DVDs of opera available.<br />Although it is old (1974) the image quality is more than fair, being a studio production The sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />The director, G&ouml;tz Friedrich, really exhibits his genius in this production.  The sets are wonderful and very atmospheric, with an immense well at the side of the stage and the courtyard of Herod's palace being as it should. The costumes are very good, but above all the acting and the movement of the principles is superb.<br /><br />Teresa Stratas must have given the performance of her life. She is perfect as Salome, playing the part of spoiled little brat that always had to have her own way, ignoring and really not caring about the consequences. She moves so much in tune with Strauss's music, she acts superbly and sings beautifully. Astrid Varnay, although grotesque in appearance portrays superbly the part of her mother. Bernd Weikl is vocally excellent and acts very well as Jochanaan, but he appears rather plumb and overfed for a starving prophet. The rest of the cast is good and Hanna Schwarz, as usual, is an asset to any production.<br />Karl B&ouml;hm and the Vienna Philharmonic provide an immensely rich orchestral sound with a very tight and dramatic conducting from B&ouml;hm.<br /><br />I have seen other productions of Salome on DVD and on the stage. I firmly believe that none of them even begins to approach this one in terms of quality. I recommend this set as being far better than all the others, including Peter Hall's superb production from Covent Garden.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVL49W">R. Strauss - Salome</a>
As a longtime Strauss enthusiast, it took me an inexplicably long time to learn to love this opera.  It was this performance that finally brought me around.  B&ouml;hm leads a magnificant and authoritative traversal of the score and the casting is nearly ideal.  While the role of Salome stretches Stratas' voice to its limits, she is visually and dramatically the most appropriate Salome on video so far.  The production, from 1974, is a bit dated, but not enough to be disruptive to the viewer.  This may be the perfect DVD for those who are new to this opera and for those who know it well.  I'd give it more than five stars, if possible!
G&ouml;tz Friedrich's production of Salome is a classic.  Stratas may not have been able to perform the title role on stage (for which Rysanek was thankful), but in this video she was wonderful.  She looks young, sounds wilfull, and dances with enough elan to be believable.  Astrid Varnay is the most memorable Herodias imaginable.  She tailors her histrionics to the screen, and the look she gives to the mention of jewels she doesn't know about is priceless.<br /><br />Beirer is not a smooth vocalist, but he is perfect for the role.  Wieslaw Ochman's Narraboth is vulnerable but beautifully sung.  Hanna Schwarz, at the beginning of her career, is a very good Page.  Bernd Weikl, looking a bit like Rubeus Hagrid, is an inspiritational Jochanaan.  B&ouml;hm is B&ouml;hm, and in this repertoire that says it all.<br /><br />We must hope that this video comes back to stores soon.
This is one of the best opera productions I've ever seen.  It is so compelling.  The singing is superb and the costuming is perfect.  I thought it must be a recently recorded piece but was astoninshed to see that it was done in the seventies.  I am thrilled to have it in my collection of opera on DVD.  Thank you so much.....Albert Kleppe
I had seen and enjoyed this performance of Salome on TV long ago, and while looking for a recording of somethig else, found that this had been released only last summer. The transfer is excellent, the performance is as riveting as it was some thirty years ago, and it is a welcome addition to my library. What more can I add?
Wonderful performance from a star who never did the opera on the stage, but she's excellent in this production- but so is the rest of the cast. Bohm, as usual, is a master with R.Strauss. Well worth the price-particularly when compared to ticket prices.
I've been hanging onto a tattered videotape of this production for years, and have been praying that it would eventually appear on DVD.  Stratas gives a riviting performance as Salome, and the rest of the cast and the conducting are equally fine.  No other production on DVD even comes close!
There may be better voices singing this role or that, but this is the defining visual record of Salome. Stratas' interpretation is brilliant. I just watched the YouTube video of the final moments: the camera inches from her face, glancing away for a bit of fine stage business by Herodias, then back -- tears streaming down my face. To understand Salome, we must feel some empathy for the title character. Stratas' Salome is not a monster; she is the demanding ego in each of us, given what she demands and not, it seems, careful enough what she wished for.<br /><br />There, I took a breath. Varnay is nothing short of brilliant, giving depth to a role that could be a walk-on, and Riegel is a suitably disgusting Herod. The Jokanaan -- I can't even remember who he is -- is weak, the only complaint I have about the production. The film uses him well, but there is never a sense -- as there must be for the drama to work -- that he and Salome are evenly matched.<br /><br />This film demonstrates that opera is ripe for CGI. Stratas could never have sung Salome on stage, and probably Monserrat Caballe never should have. Will it be in my lifetime, a film of Salome with Jon Vickers singing Herod, Welitsch Salome, Varnay or Rysanek Herodias, and Bryn Teufel as Jokanaan, while a delicate dark sylph mimes the title role? I hope so, but meantime, this recording will do just fine.<br /><br />=====<br />Circumstances gave me the opportunity to see the Berlin/Mafitano/Estes Salome on consecutive nights with this one last weekend, and if you are wavering between them, don't. The Berlin Mafitano is so inferior that the difference is laughable. It is, first of all, a videotape of a play performance, not a film. The Stratas production confines itself to the stage set, but it exploits the strengths of film brilliantly, with closeups (the shot of the tears streaming down Stratas' face toward the end of The Dance) and brilliantly composed shots like the one where Herodias slowly replaces Salome in the frame as the camera pans, montage to create excitement, and an arsenal of tools to make the never-convincing Dance appealing, artistic, and even vaguely erotic. In this production, you don't have to check the libretto to remember that Jokanaan seals his fate not by insulting Herodias but by repeating his hateful screed at Salome from inside the cistern. ("He didn't say your name, dear," Herod says to placate Herodias. That's because he isn't talking about Herodias any more; he's moved on to younger stuff.)<br /><br />More than this, the Berlin Mafitano suffers from what I think of as the German aesthetic disease -- a love of depravity for its own sake. That element is welcome in Wilde's original, which is a nasty, leering, misogynistic bit of onanism best filmed by Ken Russell. Strauss and his librettist (Hedwig Lachmann) are not telling that simpleminded story. The Berlin aesthetic can't see past it. There is a deliberate shock element in the Berlin production, typified by the full beaver climax to The Dance (which is not so much a dance as a series of Freudian calisthetics, and six of the seven veils are big hankies hanging from Mafitano's leave-nothing-to-the-imagination dance smock). But the hits keep coming. The Kiss is a gross carp nuzzle. The production seems as set on revolting as a Penthouse Caligula.<br /><br />But this is not a review of the Berlin production. There are now four or five DVD recording of Salome. If your interest is seeing an opera singer nekkid, go with the Maria Ewing. She's the weakest singer but the best dancer and convincingly youthful. (Or track down the Deidra Palmour clips on YouTube of a Florida production and settle for a G-string and the best choreography I've ever seen for The Dance.) If what you want is pictures to go with the music then frankly, you are out of luck. There is no video version to match the audio of Nilsson, Welitsch, Studer, Neilson, Rysanek, or Marton. The pictures in the Met/Mattila production are one of those what-were-they-thinking productions, in which the action takes place in 1930 on what seems to be a cruise ship; the Nadja Michael production is visually impressive but Michael's voice is not up to the demands of the role. All are videotaped productions, not films, and it shows.<br /><br />Teresa Stratas did not have the Jagdpanzer voice of a Birgit Nilsson (the only recording I know of, with Georg Solti and, I think, Jon Vickers) that comes close to the queen of Salomes, Ljuba Welitsch -- still in print if you dig for it). But with the invisible breaks that film permits, Stratas stays at top form for her harrowing 90 minutes. And what is more, she is a fine actress. The Mafitano productions (there are actually two recordings, with the difference that Simon Estes sings Jokanaan in Berlin, Terfel in Covent Garden) are ham-fisted, from the abstract sets to the bug-eyed madness of Salome. The Berlin proceeds seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are performing in our laps: What are we to make of Salome's going on and on about Simon Estes 'ivory' skin? Did no one notice that in extreme closeup, Mafitano looks her age, not Salome's?<br /><br />I've seen more productions of Salome than I can count, beginning (I think) with Dame Josephine Barstow and including a dozen unseen recordings. I can imagine a better production of Salome than the Stratas, but I doubt if I'll ever see one.
I am so happy I read these reviews....because this is the Salome I decided to add to my library especially after seeing Stratas in Pagliacci. I was in awe as this little vixen became obsessed with John the Baptist.....and the last scene with the head of John the Baptist is nothing but a shocker. This opera film is perfection....and the facial gestures of Salome and her Mom worthy of Oscars. Never has obsessive madness been so delicious.
When I first moved to New York in 1979, I had the great good fortune to be cast as a supernumerary in the Metropolitan's production of MAHAGONNY with Stratas avd Varnay.  Their artistry and talent are well known.  I can attest to their friendliness and graciousness to a new kid in town.  What happy memories- and how wonderful it is to have this SALOME on DVD.  Now, if only DG would put the Met's MAHAGONNY on DVD, life would be complete.
I concur with others' praise of this DVD for high-quality drama, opera, and music.  The one other DVD I have seen was the polar opposite: a staged (not cinematic) version in "modern" dress on a bare set.  It was uninteresting.  I've heard Inge Borkh singing the closing and I look forward to hearing Birgit Nilsson's recording from the early 1960s.  So I can't offer a comparison of the recordings available.<br /><br />What I would like to do, however, is to comment on the "scandal" thing.  Let's catalogue the obvious:<br /><br />-- Strauss's musical harmonies.<br />-- Hints (at least) of nudity.<br />-- References to incest.<br />-- Necrophilia.<br /><br />The forgotten scandal is actually the original one: portraying Biblical figures on stage.  This was even illegal in some jurisdictions at the time.  It may seem quaint now, but in fact I think it's here that Wilde struck his most scandalous blow.<br /><br />Wilde holds us in thrall with the skin scandals until the very end when suddenly Salom&eacute; sucker-punches us with: "Tu as mis sur tes yeux le bandeau de celui qui veut voir son Dieu.  Eh bien, tu l'as vu, ton Dieu, Iokanaan, mais moi, moi ... tu ne m'as jamais vue.  Si tu m'avais vue, tu m'aurais aim&eacute;e."<br /><br />Translation (of Wilde's thought, not Salom&eacute;'s words): You, John, a man of God who would save the world, when you were confronted with a young person fleeing corruption and reaching out to something that seemed to her beautiful in a way she had never experienced ... what did you do?  Did you see her for what she was and act with compassion?  No.  You saw her only through the veil of patriarchal religion, put yourself above her, and judged her.  But if you had SEEN her, you would have seen her worth.<br /><br />One of literature's great punch lines.<br /><br />Strauss's operas are of course meant to be sung and played and are great music.  This particular opera however used Oscar Wilde's play almost verbatim, so I think for once the drama is more important than the vehicle for sopranos.
I have had this performance on the old 12" video disc format for years and then the machine broke down. Now I have it back with this DVD. For those who love this opera Stradas is THE perfect Salome in the perfect vehicle. To make the leap from just great music to believability that Herodes would give up all just to see her dance you need an wonderful actress with a great voice and she's it. The production and supporting cast are wonderful as well especially since it's a film and you get views that a simple stage production can't do justice to.
I have patiently waited for this film of Salome to be released on dvd.  One couldn't ask for a more perfect performance of this opera.  A very young Theresa Stratas looks convincingly like the heroine she portays.  And I have always felt she is the greatest singing actress since Callas.  Astrid Varnay is also marvelously campy as Herodias.  If you could only have a dozen opera dvd's in your collection this should certainly be one of them.
Dark and fascinating opera about obsession, jealousy, incest and descent into madness.<br /><br />Coming into "Salome" completely unprepared and not knowing what's in store for me I was hypnotized and glued to the screen to the very end - who could ever guess that opera could be scary as best of psychological thrillers? - of course I was vaguely familiar with Biblical story about Salome but did not expect such intensity of emotions and sweeping music. It's funny how I actually watched whole darn thing with hands above my head and mouth gaping (where's Donizetti when you need him?) and even the lack of conventional arias didn't bother me, this was something completely different and the quality of sophistication and artistry involved here leaves me truly excited, though is not music I would return gladly on my own.<br /><br />This DVD presents 1974. TV version (curiously it says 1976. in the liner notes) with excellent Teresa Stratas in title role - seeing her first, for me she would forever be Salome as she has beauty, looks, poise and dangerous vibe about her. Other artists were more or less secondary, except fascinating Astrid Varnay (Salome's mother Herodias) who was truly Medusa-looking and perfect choice for this role. The fact that artists were lip-synching didn't bother me at all because it was done well and I was too involved watching anyway. Excellent. The only problem now is that I might find other opera works too trivial compared to this.
I never thought I could sit through a Salome.  The Amazon reviews were so outstanding that I was convinced that it would be a sacrilege not to purchase this DVD.  Bottom line: I sat through two performances in two nights.  It was addictive.  Teresa Stratas is Salome!  She has the vocal cords, lithe cat-like body, sensuous facial expression, and superb acting ability.  Her performance elevated the performances of her fellow performers.
Salome is, perhaps, the most thrilling Strauss Operas; the music is pure emotion and you can't stop to look and hear for a single moment. I've had heard this opera many times, including Caballe's version, and this one a number of times that I can't remember how many; that's why I couldn't resist this offer to have it forever. Teresa Stratas is perfect for the role and this time she raise the bar too high <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVL49W">R. Strauss - Salome</a>
You wouldn't think it (when you think of Stratas's slight figure), but this is a jaw-droppingly perfect rendering of Oscar's and Strauss's femme fatale.
Everything about this recording is about as good as it gets - great photography, wonderful balance between orchestra and singers, and wonderful performances from the singers.
I remember this production from televsion, and then someone made me a VHS copy from Japanese television, and when that disintigrated I spent a lot of money to get the laserdisc version and have it turned in VHS. Why?  In addition to being the superb German expressionistic production* with outstanding singer-actors (see previous reviews),I used it for years when I taught a humanities survey at Temple University.  The film shocked students into what opera can do.  It also became the basis for a paper assignment requiring students to analyze the film in terms of classic Freudian psychology.  There simply is no better Salome!<br /><br />*I do not think that anyone has mentioned this yet.  Friedrich's production is not realistic but what might be called hyper-realistic.  In this it follows Wilde and Strauss whose prose and music are "over the top".  That is the way it should be.
Great recording of this opera with stunning acting, singing and close-up filming.  Never been so fascinated by the plot, singing and acting -  all of which well known to me before.  This is a jewel of a DVD, taking advantage of things one cannot see nor hear while sitting in the opera audience.  For anybody buying this DVD, it's a bit tricky to get to the selection of the subtitles  -  for those who want to read in english what is sung in German.
This DVD is a tremendous production all the way around. Richard Strauss's Salome is simply a wonderful opera to begin with, and Teresa Stratas as Salome is simply stunning. Her voice is flawless and she is beautiful as well, able to meet the demands of the role in every way. The entire cast is superb and appropriately creepy-just amazing.
Teresa Stratas's acting is very convincing of a infatuated soul. The story itself is very heavy. I am not sure this is good for many 'Saturday-afternoon-opera' kind of audiences. I guess that is why this opera has not been well known in States / no offense.<br /><br />The file was published at 70's. For that reason, you may not get the best visual or sound qualities in compare of modern production. But, it is worth to watch, and the performance is not set back.<br /><br />I think this is an 'exhausted' opera. Not just for the orchestra which need to be seriously concentrated to do this opera. It must be extremely difficult to do the title role 'Salome'. She has to singing consistently with less-melodic music by Strauss (R), and also doing a great deal of acting. I am sure it is easy for any singers to lose many notes on this opera. It is just very difficult. I am thinking this opera is like a modern violin concerto, you just need to memorize it all. I don't know how a singer can do that. It is a miracle!<br /><br />After watch is opera, I was thinking if I were there to tell Salome, I would say "hey girl, look, it's actually ok to not posses things or person you love so much; you can still have your love and enjoy all the beautiful things around by NOT own them; such like the blue sky, and a drop of morning dew...
This DVD is a tribute to the performers in this show. Any raves you read about their skill in putting this show on screen are well deserved. Actually Teresa Stratas (Salome) & Bernd Weikl (Johanaan) aka John the Baptist, their performances are off the top end of the scale. I would have loved to see more of Weikl but it seems he lost his head.<br /><br />Astrid Varnay as Herodias is sensuality gone to seed. Bloated with the riches she has always consumed. Hans Beirer as Herodes is weak & insipid from indulging every whim he has. What a pair. He has gathered more all of his life & his wife seeks only to consume what she sees. That is of course, perfectly played by these two.<br /><br />The music matches the scenes as they are shown & listening to Strauss can cure many ills. The costuming I had heard was somewhat dull but I thought it was appropriately sensual & alluring, Salome's cap is stunning both as costume & by photography. The photography was breathtaking & can't be over valued in its impact on your experience while watching. I could easily give all this a Five Star rating so why didn't I?<br /><br />The directorial responsibility to insure a show does not dwell too long on a shot or a scene when seeking to arouse your emotions or understanding failed again & again. Does Salome have ambivalent feelings about Johanaan & when did you catch on? You are awakened by this again & again & I'll congratulate the performers here once more. They do a marvelous job even in this kind of circumstance. I remember when I saw Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring the first time, at the end (I admit they had me hooked) Bilbo is in the boat crossing the river to Mordor & Sam shows up to volunteer for drowning duty. Sam goes under & he's under & he's under & he's under & he's under & all the sudden I'm not in the show, I'm upset because the implausibility of what's on screen has brought me OUT of the show & awakened me in my chair. This repeats in Salome.<br /><br />Personal view here! I get more upset with this as time goes on. It seems to happen more & more. In any case you should not miss this show. The singing & the dramatic interplay between Salome & her own mind is deviousness itself. Her interplay with the audience & the rest of the cast is sensual & calculating. You may remember there is a dance. I would have loved to be in house to see that done again. It was an excellent example of stretching time appropriately (it brings you into the tease & eroticism). This is a powerful show, necrophilia & all.<br /><br />I must upgrade my rating to 4 1/2 stars. My pet peeve shouldn't be that powerful. Enjoy!
I'll be getting this DVD, but I'm recalling the Laserdisc iteration.  Every praise heretofore said about Stratas and Varnay is absolutely true.  BUT, and somebody has to say it, it seemed to me that a clumsy clip was made at the end of Salome's dance.  In a microsecond she had turned 180° and her backside was airbrushed.<br /><br />Two questions arise if my perception was correct:  Why?  Is the scene restored on the DVD?<br /><br />We shall see.  A viewing of Stratas in the Ponelle production of Pagliacci shows her to have more than adequate below-the-waist star quality.  And, after all, it is a video.
