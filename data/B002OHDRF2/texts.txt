I received a bare-bones copy of the movie, a video rental copy with no extras at all. I was disappointed at this. However, the copy was flawless so from that point of view I was satisfied, I LOVE extras on a DVD, they are one of the main advantages over a VHS copy.
I had to check I was watching a terminator movie.  Lots of explosions, and lots of explosions.. did i mention stuff blows up constantly?<br />You would think I would have been glued to my seat.. but I got pretty bored with this movie.  And the hybrid terminator that was more advanced than the Arny T101 was built by humans?  And the young Kyle Reese was kind of a dork.  If this was a free streaming movie on Prime I would have stopped watching it, but I paid 2.99 so I decided to see if it got any better.... NO.  It may be useful for like wallpaper background video while you have people over and your cranking some decent music.
Good plot, like the grittier feel of this installment.  Christian Bale does a good job as John Connor.  Good effects, great sound.
I got the product very fast, good price and good conditions. In addition, the movie is the best of the best movies. thanks
I bought this movie for my semester break. I have only seen it once but it was nice having it for my break.
Well, as far as cinematography having come a long way...in comparison to previous Terminator movies, I found this one the least interesting. Without having to give out spoilers, it just felt like a filler story to try and satisfy the fanatics, but it did not personally satisfy me. Perhaps it's mostly because I needed the "Gov'nah" lol. And I thought the last Terminator was "meh" (don't get me wrong, the hubby loved the hot robot chick, haha), this one was double "meh" for me.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I had to send back the first Blu Ray because when I opened it up, it contained 2 random CD-R's that were OBVIOUSLY not the the movie, lol. However, Amazon was very quick in sending out a replacement. That was a first experience with Amazon I had to deal with.
I wish I would have looked at all of the reviews closely.  The seller says nothing about this movie no longer having an active digital copy.  Since I bought the movie exclusively so that I could have the digital copy it was a "let down" when I discovered the fine print on the packaging.  DO NOT make the same mistake I made...If you are buying this for the digital movie insert - keep walking.
In terms of mindless adventure films, this one was excellent from the beginning.  Plenty of action sequences, battles, and nasty terminator robots.  I can't fault the film: it's a generous serving of goofy fun.  But it's when you get into the subplot and the mysterious Marcus character that things start to get a little bit perplexing.  Spoilers start below:<br /><br />(spoilers) From the beginning, you know something is fishy with Marcus, and there are some creative parallels suggesting he might be a terminator himself, but once the bomb is dropped and we find out that he is a strange terminator/human hybrid, then the questions start rolling in.  I lost sleep after this film, pondering how exactly certain problems in this scenario could be figured out.  For instance, he's a terminator with a human brain: wouldn't he start to question his lack of ability to eat or drink, or desire to?  And what about bathroom functions?  If you still had a human brain in a terminator body, wouldn't you start to question why those details don't matter anymore?  And how could a heart function without the rest of the circulatory system, such as lungs to give the heart oxygen, or bone marrow for blood cells, etc, etc?  And if the final terminator gave Marcus a massive damaging heart punch at the end, why would that make for a healthy heart for a transfer?  And in a post-apocalpytic setting, would they even have the facilities and medicines to accomplish a heart transplant?<br /><br />Even more perplexing is that the goofy robots of Cyberdyne would devise THIS sort of system to try to outsmart John Connor.  Wouldn't it make more sense to try more time travel, and this time go after Sarah Connor's mom, or something more linear and logical like that?<br /><br />Anyhow, if you don't read into the film, and don't think of too deeply, it's good fun.  Seeing Michael Ironsides in action again as the, well, the Michael Ironsides character again, was a nice touch as well.  But come on, did John Connor really dive into the ocean and swim into a submarine?
Terminator Salvation grows on you with each rewatching.  Christain Bale and Sam Worthington is great!<br />Blair is awesome!! "I see a man", and it thinks its human.<br /><br />Skynets virtual lady reveals the inner workings, while the 'it' chooses for itself. All great stuff.<br /><br />I'd sign on for Christian bale-Arnie number 5, and this time with plasma's in 50 watt range..
I loved the first three Terminator movies, they all had heart to them! But this one was a bit of a mis-fire!<br />What I liked about it:<br />1. Christian Bale nailed it as John Connor!<br />2. Sam Worthington's character Marcus was a great edition to the<br />Terminator universe!<br />3. The battles were well done!<br />4. The visual effects were top notch!<br />5. We sall some cool, new Terminators!<br />6. I'm glad that all the human resistance took John Connor's<br />side when Micheal Ironside put him down!<br />7. Moon Bloodgood was a great edition to the world of the Terminator!<br /><br />What I didn't like about it was:<br />1. Bryce Dallas Howard was not the best choice for Kate Connor!<br />2. Helena Bonham Carter was not the best choice for the<br />doctor (or whatever she was)!<br />3. The pace to the movie was choppy!<br />4. The lighting/coloring to the movie wasn't very impressive!<br />5. Come on, a Terminator movie without Arnold...?! What is the<br />world coming too?!<br />6. Why would a human lab/scientists turn Marcus into a<br />Terminator?<br />7. And speaking of which, didn't they destroy Cyberdine in T2?<br />8. The movie point wasn't as strong as the first three movie's<br />where (in T1, they were warned about Judgment Day, in T2, they<br />try to stop Judgment Day, in T3, we discover that Judgment Day<br />will come no matter what and it happens, but this movie simply<br />showed how John Connor became the leader of the resistance...)!<br />9. The movie was too focused on Marcus and not enough on John<br />Connor!<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a disappointment to me, they did try<br />but in the end, it was a let down!  Hopefully the next<br />one will be better!<br />My grade C+ or two-and-a-half stars!
This movie is great, if you liked the other terminator flicks, you'll love this one. They said it was a new type of terminator this time around, and they weren't kidding.
Much better than T3, good action movie. I'm not going to get as detailed into it as some of the reviews. its not a complicated movie. Are there some gaffs that "true fans" will notice and blog in their parent's basements about? Yes, but thats all movies.<br /><br />Dont like it, start a movie studio and do it right.<br /><br />Lots of nice easter eggs and references to T2. Pop some popcorn and watch. I would review the BR extras, but dont have a BR player. I rented it with the option of getting a disc, and at some point a BR player will make its way to our house. Till then...
For those who love the Terminator franchise, this will be one more in a great line of flicks.  For those who have not followed this film series before, this will be only a decent action scifi offering.  Sam Worthington puts forth a solid performance as Marcus Wright the man who becomes machine and yet somehow remains a man.  Christian Bale's intensity as John Connor does not disappoint in communicating the weight, seemingly resting upon one man's shoulders, of saving humanity from the machine intelligence Skynet.  Great special effects including some gargantuan machines wreaking various levels of havoc make it exciting.  Terminator Salvation is a dependable addition to a movie collection for the scifi enthusiast.
I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it was the best one I saw that year.  The story was straight sci fi.  The new vision of the terminator movie has a awesome variety of terminators.  They are done from a motorcycle type to a human skeleton type to a huge space ship type.  The visuals are very dark sort of like the last 2 alien movies were done.  Also I saw the late Stan Winston worked on the movie.  I think he did a lot of special effects in the alien movies.  I think he did the alien queen in aliens.<br /><br />Anyway the special effect are really well done.  I could forget about reality and just watch the screen and go to another place.  That is when the special effects are done well.<br /><br />Also the world was well done and you could tell they spent the money to design many sets and have many location to keep the viewer interested.  I compare the visuals of the world to that of Alien 3 or Alien Resurection.<br /><br />The music is done well and is very emotional.  It was done by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />The acting and story was top notch.  It is a story of sacrifice and redemption.  The two leads Sam Worthington and Christian Bale were exceptional.  Christian Bale is always good at getting you to care for his character.  I think he is an actor that can bring out a lot of emotions for the viewer.  I thought Sam Worthington was very good at this also in this movie.  The woman Moon Bloodgood was good also and believable in her role.  Anton Yelchin was also very good in his role.<br /><br />Also this movie had very mild cussing and the violence and content was not trashy or overdone.  Which I think the last terminators went overboard on this.<br /><br />Recommended to families to watch with children over 13.  I think the parents won't find anything objectionable.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this due to hearing that it wasn't good.  Give it a chance.  I liked it, maybe you will too.<br /><br />Kevin
I really like this movie, although didn't noticed the difference betwen the director's cut and the thretical version. So any way, liked the movie.
Terminator Salvation is a good re-visit to the past.  Good but not great.  A GREAT re-visit to a bonafide franchise is Die Hard 4.  Director Len Wiseman understood the material and seamlessly generated an explosive next chapter.  This is where Terminator Salvation falls short.  It borrowed too generously from the past and relied too heavily on editing to make it nothing more than a better than o.k. sequel.  Worth a watch but a missed opportunity for sequel greatness.
I love this movie, It is intense and very action packed. I seen it in theaters and I loved every minute of it.
Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the Terminator series. It's also the lesser of the four. The first three starred Ah-Nuld, and were great because of him. Terminator Salvation stars Christian Bale and is slightly above average in spite of him. The action is good, the Terminators are great (including that one that looks identical to Arnold S. circa 1984), but the story isn't. They just don't make action movies the way they used to, when they not only had good action, but they also had something to entertain you even when something wasn't blowing up. When nothing is being shot or blown up onscreen, Terminator: Salvation is pretty boring. Still, I'd take Terminator: Salvation over Transformers, Iron Man 2, and G.I. Joe.
I got Terminator Salvation for Christmas because I have the first 3 and need to keep the series going. (Doesn't everyone do that?)<br /><br />It picks up long after the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines where we see John Connor (Christian Bale) as a soldier in the human resistance against the Skynet.<br /><br />Before the first battle scene, we're privy to Sam Worthington's character, Marcus - in prison, offer his body for a "good cause".<br /><br />Marcus wakes up amid the battles and finds a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). Together, they make their way towards Skynet and bump into Connor. Reese is captured by the terminators. Marcus infiltrates the machine compound and Connor invades to destroy them once and for all.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is a nice addition to the franchise. It gives you a look at some of the things hinted at in the earlier films. It also touts some of the fiercest explosions I have seen in movies.<br /><br />However it lacks humanity. Which is pretty much the basis of the film. You don't connect with any of the characters and you really don't care who lives and who dies. Obviously you know Connor and Reese will survive this first film (of which the director would like to make 3). But you don't mind watching the other survivors bite it because you really don't care about them.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.
*Note* This review is for the theatrical version ONLY.<br /><br />First thoughts...It's not bad. I was a little worried about this one because it got a PG-13 rating when the first three were all R. It was actually very good though. Here's the breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Directing--Good job from McG (Catwoman). It had a very good camera job, I was impressed.<br />2.  Script--Good script from the same people who wrote Terminator 3, John Brancato and Michael Ferris.<br />3.  Acting--Very good. You have an all-star cast. Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Oh, and let's not be forgetting Michael Ironside.<br /><br />Now for the content review.<br />Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.<br /><br />1.  Sex/Nudity=2/10. There is a brief scene where a terminator is shown fully nude but his genitals are blurred by smoke.<br />2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. Even though it got a PG-13, it is still pretty violent.<br />3.  Language=4/10. Least language of all the Terminator movies. A couple S-words and other profanities.<br /><br />Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. I enjoyed this one far more than Terminator 3. Still, it would have been better if James Cameron directed it.
I love you terminator. Anyways, crank the surround sound and bass! i cant wait for them to make an installment with the laser sounds because just with the bullets in this one, it sounded amazing, everything!
I saw this Terminator movie and decided since I have that in my collection I also need to get the original movies especially since Arnold is the original machine. I was really excited at the animated Arnold in Terminator Salvation. It is so true that the movies are just not the same without him.
This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay!
REALLY loved this version. Story was more cohesive than the studio suits allowed it to be in the theatrical release. McG is a fine story teller and was made more evident in this director's cut. If there is more coming,will buy that too!  MOON BLOODGOOD IS HOT in this movie!!! Love seeing her on screen.
When I got to the end of this movie I was relieved to realize that I'd actually seen something new in the Terminator series and not a simple re-hash of the other movies.  99% of this movie takes place post Judgment Day and concentrates on the rise of John Connor in the resistance and the first great victory against the machines.  This wasn't a movie where I was tempted to hit the fast forward button.  The action scenes are reasonably compact and progress the plot rather than simply being there for violence alone.  This movie leaves you with a feeling you have watched the foundation for at least one more Terminator movie, and if that is case I hope it retains the same actors and director as I liked the feeling of progression that you got from the story line here.<br /><br />For me, Sam Worthington was a surprise. The only other movie I've seen him in is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray</a>] and this confirms that he has a steady screen presence good enough to hold up a full length movie without a tonne of cgi.  In all, I was glad I took the time to watch this installment of this series and it makes me hopeful for the next movie.
Here is one the critics didn't think too much off, but both the wife and I found it enjoyable.  If you have seen the other Terminator movies, this fills in some good information on the series.  It is well acted and has plenty of action and I thought a very good story line.  One mans opinion but I recommend it for all action movie viewers.
The blueray picture is always better than the DVD and the extra's are nice as well. The movie plot was so-so, but I was entertained throughout and thats what counts.
If you enjoy movies that special effects have a starring role, you will like this one.  Also I'm a big fan of Christian Bale, so what more can I say?
While i dont think any terminator could be as good as the first 2.  This one comes pretty close.  You know how in the the 1st one it kept going to flashforwards to the future and how scary it was.  well in this movie youre in that enviroment the whole time.  Skulls all over the ground, people living underground, terminators lurking around every corner.  Its awesome bc i always loved those scenes in the first one.  the story is about a guy in jail who got the death penalty and hes signs to give his body over to science, but instead later in the future he wakes up to realize hes a terminator.  he meets up with john conners dad kyle reese, who is younger than he is, as they try to get away from the terminators.  Later kyle convinces the terminator guy (i forget his name at the moment) to meet up with john and they also meet up with a beautiful woman and they fall for each other.  when they finally meet up with john and he realizes the guy is a terminator he has trouble trusting him and locks him up.  but the woman rescues him and then to prove hes a good guy he tries to help find kyle reese who gets kidnapped by the bad termiators.  anyway you must see it if youre a fan of sci fi movies or the terminator movies, and who isnt right?
but there was this one part that had me laughing, the resistance, cops or whoever had freakin dogs with them to hunt down terminators ... lol ... freaking dogs!
love the blue ray, it's better than the theater. this is one of the best terminator movies made. Christian Bale brings his usual intensity to the role of John Conner.  well done
As action films go there is action.  That is fine for a big screen TV, but not worth the theater screen fare.  Honestly, T1 & T2 were the best in the series and should have stopped there.  All those that followed are just confused, inconsistent messes. Yep, the action is there but plot, story line, dialog, and acting are...well...never fluid.  This film with McG and Bale prove it.  If you want action it is here, if you are looking for rebirth of the franchise and substance...no it is not here.
I recently watched this movie and I really enjoyed it.  Having seen the previous three movies, I was skeptical, but it really had good continuity; especially with the first two Terminator movies.  I think they should actually make another movie to continue this story line.  What I didn't like was the way Amazon constantly changed the price and finally bumped up the full screen addition to $24.99.  I went to ebay and bought it brand new for $9.99.  Amazon needs to be more competitive.
Buy or rent? Buy or rent? What to do...what to do? Well, here's a word of advice: If you're like me and you want to see the Director's Cut (the R version) versus the Theatrical PG-13 version, buy this. Because I first rented it from Netflix, but Netflix is sending out a Blu Ray version that's PG-13. I found this especially odd because I can't find a Blu Ray version for sale that's PG-13. So how and why is it that Netflix's Blu Ray version of Terminator Salvation is PG-13?<br /><br />Am I sure? Yes, I'm sure. There is no mention of Director's Cut on the Netflix sleeve or the disc itself. The disc did indeed say Blu Ray. And right before the movie starts it says rated PG-13 by the MPAA. But the solid evidence came from watching the Netflix version and finding that there was none of the Director's Cut extra's so perfectly outlined in Senor Zoidbergo's lead customer review on the Amazon front page for this product.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.<br /><br />And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale; Worthington's performance in Salvation may even get me to get out to the theater to see Avatar and next year's remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKO7">Clash of the Titans</a>. Gotta give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn (the guy who played Reese in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9RB9Y">Terminator</a>.<br /><br />But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2:</a> delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.<br /><br />Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental, but if you rent it at least be sure that you're getting the Director's Cut. One way to be sure that you get the Director's Cut is to add this now to your Amazon cart. Buy or rent? Buy or rent? What to do...what to do?
Lots of action and thrills here, if not enough decent acting. But that's hardly the point of this franchise, and on that level T4 delivers. The script is ok, and the basic concept is a good one. If all you want is some high-tech whiz-bangery, this should do it.<br /><br />Disconcertingly, at various moments in the film it's not easy to know if Christian Bale is man or machine; his somewhat wooden style is almost uber-ironic here. But McG continues to deliver the goods, visually, though this one feels somehow hollow, despite excellent effects. T4, while better than T3, never approaches T2. But then again, James Cameron has rather more of a sense of humor than McG.<br /><br />Worth watching after you've seen T2 three or four times, perhaps.
This will probably turn out to be the strangest 5 star review you've ever read so bear with me. I will start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish! I had really high expectations from the moment the initial trailer was released and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least. This is an action movie of the highest order! The CGI was outstanding! I have to take issue with those reviewers who claimed the CGI was not realistic. I have to disagree. I would say this is one of the more realistic CGI movies I've ever seen! The entire movie had a gritty, organic feel to it that was at once bleak and beautiful. Those of you looking for a slam bang good time filled with explosion after explosion you will be very happy.<br /><br />However - and this is a BIG however - those of you looking for a movie with any kind of depth, emotion, or character development will be sorely disappointed! This ain't T2 people! The thing that made Terminator 2, and to a certain extent the original Terminator, so compelling was the depth of emotion James Cameron (absolute genius that he is) brought to his characters. The idea behind T2 was that if a machine, built for the sole purpose of death and destruction, can develop human feelings of empathy and compassion, then perhaps there is hope for all of us. The initial reviews of Terminator Salvation hinted at a similar theme: what does it mean to be human in a world where most vestiges of humanity have been wiped from the face of the earth? It is a terrific concept; unfortunately the opportunity is completely wasted. Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington who is a beast of an actor) is a very intriguing character, but he is never allowed to develop much of an arc. In the end he just feels like someone else put into the movie to shoot guns when he could have been so much more. Christian Bale brings the same dour, one note quality to John Conner that he brings to Batman. That raspy grumble of a voice works for The Dark Knight but here it's just off-putting. He is the bad-ass you'd expect John Conner to be, but for someone who is on the life-changing mission that he is on, he shows zero emotion. The same is true for every other human character in the movie. The machines may not have yet succeeded in wiping out humans physically from the planet, but they have definitely succeeded in wiping out their souls!<br /><br />I also would have been okay with more time dedicated to the inner-workings of Skynet, or at least a little more history on how Judgment Day actually came to be. Perhaps that will be a topic for yet another sequel, but it could have gone a long way in this movie.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this movie because it has all the look and feel of a great Terminator movie. Unfortunately it has none of the soul. Again, all you action/ adventure junkies (like me) will be in heaven. Those of you looking for anything more beyond the surface, stick with T2.<br /><br />And a quick note about the DVD: the fact that there are NO special features included in the standard DVD release is disgraceful! I agree with virtually every other reviewer that this is a greedy move by WHV to force people to buy into their BS blu-ray format. The only thing this move will do is make me stay away from blu-ray that much more!  Nice job Warner!!
I really enjoyed this movie.  I've seen all the Terminator movies, I don't listen to critic's, I never have. I like what I like.
&lt;&lt;&lt; A few continuity errors (spoilers?) follow the Octothorpes >>><br /><br />Earlier this year I enjoyed "Terminator Salvation" on a big-screen digital theater with a group of sci-fi friends and we all loved it. Then, being a huge fan of the Terminator franchise, I jumped at the chance to buy the 2-disc Blu-ray release. I just finished watching the "Director's Cut" and must admit to you all that "I Forgot How Good This Movie Is". It is a good sci-fi story, as well as a good sci-fi movie.<br /><br />But let's be realistic, it was the only sci-fi movie of 2009. "Transformers 2" was a fantasy and "Star Trek (reboot)" was a futuristic soap opera with one of the poorest sci-fi plots I've ever seen in a movie theater.<br /><br /> #########################################################<br /><br />&lt;&lt;&lt; Tiny Continuity Errors >>><br /><br />1) in both releases, there is a noticeable annoying gap between the time that John Connor "exits the rescue plane" then "enters the submarine". This could have been easily fixed.<br /><br />2) in the Director's Cut, the rain mysteriously stops between the time that John Connor leaves Blair Williams then returns to save her from attack by three men. This could have been easily fixed.<br /><br />3) one possible plot weakness: all throughout the movie, people (including John Connor) are using two-way radios. You would think that Skynet would have been able to home-in upon these signal sources, and maybe Skynet did. Now if you think of Skynet as a chess-playing gaming system (TSCC fans know what I am talking about here), then even the voice of John Connor on the radio may not have been as valuable to Skynet as the destruction of the submarine which represented the top of the Resistance's command-control system. (think of a gambit in chess when one piece is bypassed in favor of a possible superior future outcome)<br /><br />4) This is not a complaint, just a statement: Many people think the naked Terminator seen in the last part of the movie was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actor was really Roland Kickinger with Arnold's face tweaked onto Roland's body via CGI.<br /><br /> #########################################################<br /><br />Two Blu-ray discs along with a digital-rights DVD (to download a Digital Copy to your PC) for less than $20. I hope bargain prices like this remain after the economy recovers.
Terminator Salvation is the fourth installment of the famed Terminator series, originally started by James Cameron with 1984's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPOAM0">The Terminator</a> and followed by its spectacular sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VLBDD0">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day</a> (1991). However, series suffered a quality setback after the departure of Cameron from the series leaving Jonathan Mostow as the series' spearhead. What followed was a terribly poor sequel (2003's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I7SGR8">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a>) that in spite of its high octane action sequences, fell into a low of epic proportions due to its uneven tone, useless humor and lack of focus. Six years later, the baton is handed over to McG, the director of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056PMV">Charlie's Angels</a> films. Already seeming like a fish-out-of-water, McG put together quite a capable trailer that showcased some enticing scenes. However, the film itself didn't amount to the promise of its trailer.<br /><br />The film is the first Terminator film set during the post-apocalyptic future and focuses on John Connor (now played by Christian Bale) who attempts to lead the resistance to a victory against the genocidal machines. A new character by the name of Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington) is introduced into the series as a counterpart to Connor's heroism. The problem the film suffers from is that it was written by John Brancato & Michael Ferris (writers of David Fincher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HZP">The Game</a>) who wrote T3. Obviously not improving on their previous debacle, they only add to the series' downfall by attempting to re-gather the serious tone lost with T3 but essentially adding no soul capable enough to make the film even slightly memorable. The characters all seem one-dimensional and the stiff performances of Bale and Worthington don't help. Although none of the actors who portrayed John Connor in film were impressive actors (Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl), they at least had personality and a visible soul whether it be the childlike performance of Furlong or the weathered adult performance of Stahl. With Bale, it's difficult to reason how anybody would be attracted to this personification of him as a less-than-enigmatic leader.<br /><br />With Salvation, the filmmakers attempted to introduce a new character to take the reigns from Connor. It might have seemed plausible with Bale's Connor seems so taciturn and soulless but Worthington who never impressed me with anything he done, adds nothing to his new character. Anton Yelchin, while a promising young actor, seems greatly out of place in this post-apocalyptic, science fiction, action thriller. McG's direction goes nowhere as the film feels so mechanical and boring as opposed to life-like and energetic. The writing has no great points, no memorable lines and no highlights to speak of. The absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton also weigh on the film's potential as they were two people along with James Cameron that made the first two films work in the first place. With a gross far less than its two predecessors and an overall critical reception dramatically far less than any of its predecessors, Terminator Salvation is quite possibly if not most probably the worst Terminator film ever made.
The film Terminator Salvation, has some good points to it, and some bad points, as well. Plenty of action, good visual effects, we see more about the machines, John Connor's character, as an adult is more developed. Now, for some of the bad points, it's still the same Terminator story, being retold again, compared to the first two films, which were, fresh and original, when they came out. The other characters' in the film weren't so interesting, except, maybe, Marcus. The story isn't resolved by the end of the film, either.
I thought this was a great Science Fiction film. Granted it was later surpassed by District 9 and Avatar, but this movie was the best one for the summer. It wasn't without problems, but it had a terrific atmosphere to it, a lot of innovative shots and an exciting plot which moves along nicely.  This is what I expected from this film, a sort of a prequel and a sequel that sets up the events of the apocalypse, of the Skynet fallout.  What's not to like here? The cool characters? the solid acting by Bale, Worthington, Kyle Reese, the Moon character.. the intense fighting scenes? the feeling of the great sadness... similar to that of Battlestar Galactica Reimagined? It was all quite beautiful.
In the future, John Connor leads the human resistance against Skynet, a worldwide force of sentient machines hell-bent on destroying mankind, whom are viewed as mortal enemies.  In The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the title role, as a cyborg who has been sent back in time to kill John's mother Sarah Connor; it is believed that eliminating Sarah would prevent John from being born and allow the machines to "win."  A man named Kyle Reese is also sent back, by the humans, to protect Sarah; he succeeds, hence Skynet's attempt fails, and we find out that Kyle ends up being the father of the unborn John Connor.  Terminator 2: Judgement Day focuses on another killing machine, the T-1000, as it is sent back in time to kill John himself as a child, to fulfill the same purpose.  Yet again, the machines are met with failure.<br /> Way back when I saw Terminator 2 for the first time, I remember thinking that the storyline was one of the coolest in any of the movies I had seen.  That was over 12 years ago, when I hadn't seen many movies to begin with.  Even today, T2 stands as one of the best ever; the action, acting, music, and even special effects stand the test of time and still blow me away every instance I watch.  The Terminator, which I saw very soon after, filled in all the gaps and then some to a franchise that haunts me to this day.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to be widely regarded as a critical failure and misstep in the series, a mockery of everything T1 had foretold and T2 had knocked out of the park: the antics of an aged Arnold Schwarzenegger, a "Terminatrix," and a seemingly bad choice of actor for John Connor's character.  I couldn't disagree more; Arnie once again rocked, Nick Stahl pulled off a wonderfully believable John Connor, and the twist ending in my mind made for a more than worthy addition to one of my all-time favorite movie series.  And then there was the sadly now-defunct Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV series, also berated by many fans.  I thought it was genius in every regard.  If you couldn't tell, I'm a rabid Terminator fan.<br /> Fast forward to 2009, where director McG has unleashed Terminator Salvation upon the world.  I had been looking forward to this film for many months, not only because it's another Terminator movie, but because McG had a trump card:  Christian Bale of recent Batman fame as survivalist John Connor.  I was absolutely certain that both of these beloved factors combined would make for yet another masterpiece that would be treasured in the Terminator collection.  And days after I've seen it, I'm still not ready to determine whether or not it belongs there.<br /> The Terminator series, in my mind, were always more than just action movies.  They were foreboding, horrifying windows into the potential dangers of technology and nuclear war.  The state of the planet after Judgement Day, the machine-initiated nuclear attack, as illustrated by James Cameron in T1 and T2, was dark, menacing, bleak, and felt frightfully real.  Terminator Salvation changes that, not necessarily on purpose, but because the film feels like a repackaging of the first two, wrapped in the pretty red bow of current action movie pap all too common in today's world of short attention spans.  Salvation focuses on two main things: John Connor trying to find and save the life of Kyle Reese (who turns out to be his father), and on a man named Marcus who wants revenge on the machines for very different reasons.<br /> Fortunately, Salvation does do one thing very well:  keep the viewer on the edge of their seat with tons of action sequences and great special effects.  Those expecting another deep, existential, philosophical twist relating to the Terminator mythology however, will be disappointed.  This is really the paradoxical thing about Terminator Salvation:  I honestly did enjoy the movie.  But I can't seem to lump it with the other Terminator movies.  Maybe it's Christian Bale, whom I worship; he just plain and simple is not a good John Connor.  He acts his tail off, but I can't help but feel that he was brought on board for "star power."  Maybe it's McG's illustration of the state of the planet; post-Judgement Day is that of a desert wasteland, akin to the most recent movie outages of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy instead of the perpetual blackness and skull-ridden world of James Cameron.  Maybe it's the lack of emotive or relatable music short of the five-beat drum pattern synonymous with the Terminator series.  The whole thing feels, well, like someone did a Terminator movie just to do a Terminator movie.<br /> Those willing to overlook these nuances, though, are in for a treat.  Ripe with action, Salvation rarely lets the action movie reigns loose.  Vehicle chases, gun battles, and Terminator versus human hand-to-hand all brings the action part of the movie full circle.  Every turn is met with another shootout, another violent combat sequence, or another explosion.  The introduction of Marcus's character is a good one, too, adding somewhat of a branch to Connor's ongoing focus, and towards the end of the movie, secrets are revealed relating to Marcus's character that I found quite interesting.  In a risky move, as opposed to the other Terminator movies, Bale's Connor is a full-fledged military leader, both giving orders and taking them, and participates in several action scenes, including the long, final one that also includes a surprise cameo.<br /> As a stand-alone action movie, Terminator Salvation is quite good, but will let down the longtime franchise fan.  You'll be entertained, as long as you don't want to leave thinking about where the series will go next.  As for me, I'd just as soon watch another season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles, ponder the events surrounding Judgement Day, and out of the corner of my eye see Terminator Salvation sticking out of my DVD collection waiting for a rainy day.
I had high hopes, like many, going into this film. As a fan of the franchise, I was looking forward to that "blown out of my seat" experience the other films of this saga have given me. Besides which, this is the film we've all been waiting for since the beginning, right? The future war! The resistance vs. Skynet! It couldn't possibly be bad, could it? Oh, you couldn't be more wrong!<br /><br />This film lacked anything in the way of atmosphere or suspense. The mood of the film was extremely flat from almost the start and never really came to life. On top of that, I feel too much time was spent on the machines and not enough on John Connor and the humans (whom you'd think we should be rooting for). Sam Worthington's character, of the man made into a machine, never gained any sympathy or interest from me. The fact they gave away the "secret" to his character in the trailers, certainly didn't help that, either. His character's actions are schizophrenic, at best, half the time making little sense, if any, and almost never ring true. A major flaw, to be sure, with how much time he gets on screen. And where is the dark dystopian world, filled with death and destruction? One where humans are an endangered species, that are the prey to the machines that now rule? The glimpses we've seen in the past films are completely ignored here, which hurts the continuity of the franchise and this film's place within it.<br /><br />Then you have Christian Bale, who plays John Connor as a "Batman-lite" affair. He uses the same kind of voice here, that he did in "The Dark Knight" and it just doesn't work. He portrays none of the charisma and leadership that we know the character is supposed to have. All the emotions we've felt for him in the past are all stripped away here, as he comes off like a whiny and self-absorbed jerk. Hardly one you'd want being the savior of the human race. None of the other resistance members get enough screen time to make any kind of impression on you, so you never develop any bond in what might happen to them. I don't know if the cast just didn't care about the film, or if the script just gave them nothing to work with, but there is no fire in any of the performances.<br /><br />And even if the script doesn't let the actors down, it has more than a few problems itself. They never really explain why Sam Worthington's character is the one chosen by Skynet. The story never gives you any feelings of dread or panic, despite tons of action on the screen. And while those action sequences are well shot and choreographed, they lack any real excitement. It never gets your pulse pounding. Plus there are tons of little things in the film, like Connor's wife being pregnant, which get no explanation or even a passing mention. I mean, what's the point in doing that, if it doesn't mean anything? And why is Skynet herding people into camps (ala the Nazis)? Shouldn't it simply be destroying all human life, to protect itself and win the war? It is another plot point that makes no sense, nor is given any reasoning for, in a script filled with them. Worst of all, and the one major flaw that ruins the whole film for me, is how, after Skynet has captured Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, in one of the few decent performances in the film), it doesn't kill him immediately, but uses him as bait to lure John Connor into a rescue mission. This kind of thinking, in terms of revenge and greed, is an emotional human failing Skynet should not have. It is a machine. It should know the simple equation: "Kill Kyle Reese, John Connor is no more!" The only reason for it, is to provide the big end battle, where Connor faces the Terminator 101-model (with CGI used to show Arnold in his prime). It's all just a wasted effort and doesn't deliver any thrills.<br /><br />Many folks blasted "T3" for some of the inconsistencies it had, but compared to this mess of a film, it was sheer cinematic brilliance! "Terminator Salvation" could truly be considered a franchise killer, on par with the fiasco that "Batman and Robin" was for the Batman one. Old school fans of this saga will not find this enjoyable, and any attempts to bring in new fans will be dashed at the overly-complicated back-story used to get them up to speed on this film. In short, this is a film that will appeal to few people, be they fans of these films or not. It is a complete waste of time, money and talent. And that is the purest definition of the term "whipped up movie," which this effort most assuredly is, that I can think of! It is easily one of the most disappointing films I've seen in some time.
T2 is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made - it's layered with modern themes, awesome action, and inspired performances from Hamilton, Furlong, and Morton. Cameron is a jerk, but his directing is intense - we rarely see such daring REAL stunt work anymore.<br />Outside of that, Terminator: Salvation stacks yet another mediocre attempt against an otherwise compelling idea. The effects are first class, there are some decent action sequences (well choreographed) but they can't save the plot which is held together with sheep hairs. If you're a fan, you'll find yourself going, "what?" and "I knew it!" alternately through the film. But you'll also say "that was cool" a few times, too. Just don't expect another T2... it's hard to outshine such brilliance, and the Terminator series struggles to meet the bar of regular film offerings with every installment.
I'm a fan of the first two Terminator films.  T2 is a brilliant piece of cinema, in terms of both special effects and plot.  The character development in the script, and the subsequent performances by the actors, was leveraged superbly by director and franchise creator Jim Cameron.  Even Ah-nold kept it together enough to portray a cyborg as something more than a one-dimensional machine.<br /><br />So it was with some anticipation that I purchased the (hopefully) LAST installment in the Terminator franchise: Terminator Salvation.  It's depressing to note that, for the $200 million it cost to make this film, 500 college students could have had a 4-year free ride to Stanford, and we as a species would be significantly closer to a cure for cancer.<br /><br />Alas, not so.  This film is devoid of any perceivable cinematic value, other than as an excuse to blow stuff up for two hours.  Given that director McG is famous for pyrotechnic stunts and infamously weak in plot and character development, I should have known what to expect.  But here's what I didn't expect:<br /><br />****** WARNING: SPOILER ALERTS ******<br /><br />-- Endless cheesy homages to the original Terminator films: "Come with me if you want to live;" "I'll be back;" fleeing from danger in a mini-camper; one-armed shotgun pumping (btw, Sarah Connor did it because her other arm was BROKEN, not because it was "cool," Anton); a factory battle-to-the-death featuring molten steel and a "frozen" terminator; and, sadly, more.<br /><br />-- Endless cheesy homages to classic films in general.  The elevator ride in the big climax before Skynet goes (predictably) boom, a la Sigourney Weaver in Aliens; McG's own characterization of the escape of Markus, Star, and Kyle Reese from the ill-fated desert gas station (oh, and yeah--just like in T2--a boy, a female, and a cyborg seek shelter in an abandoned desert GAS STATION) as being "like the Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow" in the Wizard of Oz, in which they "ease on down" (The Wiz) "the yellow brick road" (The Wizard of Oz) in their escape (I'm surprised he failed to liken the motobots chasing after them as flying monkeys).  Disturbing, however, was McG's literal on-camera reference to a moment in which cyborg Markus heads into danger instead of fleeing as being "just like the firefighters in 911, who we homaged in that scene" (I kid you not -- see the Blu-ray theatrical release disc's extra features).<br /><br />-- The inability of Sam Worthington to decide whether he should deliver his lines with an American accent, or his native Australian accent; and the inability of McG to direct him either way (maybe he was elsewhere on set blowing stuff up).<br /><br />-- Christian Bale's mono-dimensional performance of John Connor, in which he appeared less animated than a T-600 and uninspired to deliver his lines in any voice other than a hoarse shout.<br /><br />-- The completely galling, almost giddy revelation of Anthony Simonaitis, the Key Powder Foreman (again, watch the movie's popup-enhanced Blu-ray version) that, while filming the gas station demolition scene in New Mexico, "we had to keep a 50-feet column of fire (burning) for 2 more days; (so we) built a steel framework, hooked that up to a fuel tanker ... and burned 2000 gallons of fuel over the course of 2 days."<br /><br />McG: The Ozone Layer just called; it wants its atmosphere back.<br /><br />If there was an Oscar for Blowing Stuff Up, Terminator Salvation would be Academy-worthy.  Otherwise, this film represents nothing more than $200 million up in smoke.
Let me begin this by saying that I am a very big Terminator fan.  I loved the three previous films, the third being the weakest in my opinion, and even loved the way that the television series was so true to the mythology of The Terminator.  Though the Terminator Salvation did stay true to the mythology in terms of characters, location and historic story development.it simply fell short.  Mc.G is an okay director....though the only thing I really half like of his is Charlies Angels full throttle.  The cast is outstanding, and do put in a good performance...but the overall story of the film is wanting.  Unlike the previous Terminator outings this film is not about fighting the future...instead this film is about a futuristic fight.  The Terminator story line was simplified into a futuristic war movie.  Don't get me wrong...it was kinda cool to see the war with the machines in live action...but they could have and should have done more to make this story not only follow the mythology but "feel" like a Terminator film, quite literally you could have called this film Transformers 1 1/2 and it would have been just as good.  The need for the future to be unknown, changing, and chasing after the present is one of the coolest things about the Terminator movie franchise and is one of the things that is desperately missing from this film...and keeps it from fitting comfortably in the Terminator series.<br /><br />I literally felt robbed after this film, not only does the film not feel like a Terminator movie...but after its all said and done, as a viewer you realize that it was nothing more than a set up for a squeal.  The failure for the Production Team to get the idea of the Terminator Mythos correct is devastating to this movie, and the shotty writing and reliance on spacial effects to carry the film is it's downfall.  In short this movie is allot of popcorn fun...but a very bad Terminator Movie.
The movie was well made with action, action, and then more action.<br />I couldn't really find a plot or figure out just exactly who the good<br />guys were until nearly the end of the movie. Teenagers will love it.<br />Adults will probably get bored, like I did
This review is for the unrated extended blu-ray version. Plenty of spoilers so read at your own discretion. Although, my expectations for this movie were pretty low to begin with, since the movie wasn't directed by James Cameron and T3 wasn't as good as T2, I was at least expecting something that would extend the terminator storyline and mythology from the television show The Sarah Connor Chronicles (which was an excellent TV series) and from the comics. Unfortunately, the people who wrote the script for this movie and the director, McG are completely ignorant and clueless when it comes to the entire Terminator canon. Nothing in this movie makes any sense when you consider the previous three films. It's like these people just threw out everything from the first three films and then started making up stuff as they went along without any thought into what came before or the history that Cameron created.<br /><br />First, in this movie the machines all know who John Connor is which makes no sense if you follow the history. The audience is so used to the idea that Skynet knows all about Connor that this error usually passes over them without any thought, but what they forget is that only the machines from the future know who Connor is and only because of what he WILL accomplish in the future. He hasn't done ANYTHING yet. All the terminators from the previous films were from the future while the machines in this movie are in the present. The machines have just wiped out most of humanity and now sees them nothing more than a bunch of insects to finish exterminating. Connor at this point is just another insect so this idea that he is somehow important to them is ludicrous. Don't give me this crap about him being seen as a prophecy or messiah either.<br /><br />Second mistake is that the machines all know who Kyle Reese is which provides one of the biggest plot holes in this movie and goes against even common sense. The entire purpose of the first movie was that the machines didn't know who the father was so their only alternative was to terminate the mother which is why they built the damn time machine in the first place, in order to wipe out his entire existence. In fact information about the father was so secretive that not even Kyle Reese knew it. If the machines know who Kyle Reese is then why the hell would they even bother building the time machine when Connor's very existence depends on it? How the hell are they going to explain that in future sequels if there will be one? This is a massive disaster of a plot hole that can't be overlooked and can't be explained. It's idiotic. And don't give me this crap about alternate timelines or other theories on time travel that's different from the one used in Back to the Future. The rules of time travel and the theory used from the first trilogy have already been in place which is the Back to the Future scenario so you just don't make up new rules and change the canon to suit your logic. That's similar to that idiotic scene from AVP Requiem when the Predalien lays eggs inside pregnant women for the sole purpose of increasing the alien infestation. Only the damn queen lays eggs, stupid! And that still wouldn't explain why Skynet builds the time machine in the future either!<br /><br />Third plothole is when Skynet captures Kyle Reese they don't decide to execute him right then and there but instead have some kind of elaborate plot in order to lure Connor to execute him. Does this make any sense? What the hell was McG (what the hell kind of name is this) and the writers thinking when they came to this scene? Forget about your stupid theories on time travel when you can't apply it here (see second plot hole). This is so blatantly stupid that words can't describe the idiocy behind it. Who writes this stuff and not see the inherent problems with it?<br /><br />Fourth problem was when Connor arrives the T800, instead of breaking Connor's neck decides to play ball with him by throwing him around. I thought T800s have detailed files on human anatomy and how to efficiently terminate humans. You'd think that having their biggest sought out target within their grasp they'd kill him as quickly as possible and with a gun instead of a naked unarmed Arnold.<br /><br />Fifth problem comes at the end when they need to do a heart transplant on John, using Marcus's heart. This scene was supposedly changed due to leakage of the original script but it still doesn't excuse it's sloppiness. This scene requires that Marcus is an acceptable donor, plenty of immunosuppressive drugs, a heart surgeon and a team of anesthetics and not a veterinarian, and a sterile environment instead of the open desert. I was cringing at this scene and thank God it didn't last very long.<br /><br />Now as for the movie itself, if you are completely ignorant of the previous three films this movie would be somewhat entertaining for the action scenes alone which were very thrilling. But the audience doesn't really care about any of the characters except for maybe Marcus so the movie become nothing more than one action set piece after another. There's really no character development or insight into who these people are and why we should care about them. What made T2 and other movies like it so successful is that we get to know the characters where the audience have an emotional investment so we are concerned about them and anxiously curious about what will happen next. The action is there to supplant the characters not drive them. This movie should have been about how John Connor becomes leader of the Resistance and help humanity come back from the brink of extinction instead of this goofball storyline filled with plot holes. I won't bother going into the special features on the blu-ray or the deleted scenes which have already been discussed. I'll just add that the video transfer is impeccable and the audio is excellent as well and is what is expected from blu-ray by now.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are expecting forgetful mindless action, explosions with killer robots, and don't necessarily care about character development or plot then this movie is adequate. But if you are a fan of the terminator franchise then you will be sorely disappointed from the glaring plot holes, mistakes, and literal lack of respect for the mythology and the fan base. It's comparable to George Lucas using midichlorians to explain the Force. Much like having top tiered actors in The Phantom Menace, not even Christian Bale aka Batman can save this turkey. Time to terminate this franchise or return it back to Cameron.
Upon learning that Hollywood is about to flog a dead horse, with the help of two amateur 'schmuck' producers, one could not help but be apprehensive. However, with Christian Bale onboard, things got interesting. Fresh from his stunning success of "The Dark Knight", Bale might infuse credibility into an already exhausted franchise that spanned 25 years.<br /><br />When McG was announced as the director, one could only reflect on how much McG's body of work pales in comparison to that of James Cameron's. Cameron was smart enough not to touch any further Terminator sequels with a ten-foot pole. He has finished telling his story with T2 and decided to leave it at that. Unfortunately, Arnie had to make T3 as his swansong before his foray into governorship in order to boost his flagging popularity.<br /><br />Now, we come to this: T4, aka Terminator: Salvation. Since this takes place in the future, it's another portrayal of a bleak future. But this is no "Blade Runner". McG is no James Cameron or Ridley Scott. Heck, he's not even George Lucas, even in the Star Wars prequel movies. As much as he tries, McG couldn't direct actors. Bale is a fine actor. But not all humans are perfect. All he needs is the right director to point him to the right direction. Christopher Nolan succeeded tremendously in the resurrected Batman movies and the underrated 'The Prestige'. Terence Malick brought out an understated Bale in "The New World". Michael Mann had him in Elliot Ness style in "Public Enemies".<br /><br />Christian Bale basically sleepwalked into his role. He works his usual style: being intense. It works with him as Batman as the character is intense. Here, his intensity comes across as being pretentious. His acting here reminds me of 'Harsh Times'. In both movies, he tries too hard to be intense. He looks constipated, sorry to say that. McG is just interested in action and effects. He should fire his editors, one very badly edited scene was the sole nude scene from Moon Bloodgood and the transition to her fighting a few guys. Very badly edited.<br /><br />If you have nothing good to say about others, then remain silent. I shall do the same for Hollywood current 'IT' boy: Sam Worthington.<br /><br />Basically, if you are looking at a lame and mundane Sci-fi movie with the high pretensions of an epic, then this movie is for you. There is however one merit to this Blu-Ray edition. The DTS-HD audio will practically bring down your house. I had to tune my amplifier lower. The opening credits alone gives your speakers and subwoofer a mighty workout. The audio is definitely reference quality. Home cinema enthusiasts should check this disc out. Movie buffs should stay far, far away from this.
Sometimes, you wonder when it's time to stop, and let a franchise die.  Or at the least, make sure the story is coherent and fits in well with what's come before.  But most importantly, try to give the story weight.  If we don't care about what's going on, pretty much nothing is going to save the film, and that's the problem with Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />Taking place in 2018, the film follows the famed John Connor and newcomer Marcus Wright, as both men fight for their lives in the post-judgment day world.  Killer machines roam the skies and the ground.  While the resistance has found a possible way to shut down the machines for good, the fate of mankind hangs in the balance, as the legendary Kyle Reese, John's father, has been found.  The problem is, the machines are after him.  With both John and Skynet after Kyle, both sides must fight for the fate of the future.<br /><br />When I first saw the movie in theaters, I left feeling that the film was, at best, an average action adventure movie.  After seeing it again on DVD, time has not been kind to "Salvation", as the story feels very disjointed and choppy, as if the film was hacked to pieces and then edited back together.  It feels like entire segments of the film are missing, and the second half of the film moves too quickly for us to get emotionally interested.  By the time the end credits rolled around, I just didn't care.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the story, or even the action.<br /><br />This is probably Terminator Salvation's biggest problem...for all the action sequences, for all the nods to the previous films, the story is the weakest yet in the series.  While the idea of saving Kyle Reese to ensure the events of the future/past happen sounds like a great idea, having the film jump back and forth between Marcus and John makes it feel disjointed.  We don't get time to understand the characters in any meaningful way, besides the most basic of reasons.  John wants to save Kyle.  Marcus wants to find out who he is.  Barnes wants to avenge his brother's offscreen death.  Kyle wants to stay alive.  As a result, we have a cast of essentially one dimensional characters that pale in comparison to the cast of the previous three films.  Some, like Star, are completely unnecessary and could have been cut from the script.<br /><br />Say what you will about Terminator 3 (I personally really enjoyed it), but it had a focused plot that added to the franchise's mythology with the revelation that Judgment day was just postponed, not stopped.  The film had weight to it, making us wonder if the heroes were going to stop Judgement Day once again.  Here, everything is back to the status quo at the end.  There are no long term changes or consequences of the ongoing story.  There's just no emotional weight to what's going on, and coupled with the disjointed pacing and thin characters, the film feels utterly flat.  Considering how all the previous stories have at least contributed much to the ongoing story, "Salvation"'s story is a disappointment.<br /><br />With the poor story and characters, we're left with the action sequences, and regrettably, they don't fare much better.  We have the standard chase scenes with cars, assaults on Skynet bases, and fights with killer robots, but most feel like your standard issue summer action scenes.  The nighttime escape scene in the forest, for example, is utterly flat, save for the sequence in the river.  Then there's the giant transformer like robot at the gas station...I thought it was goofy in the theater, and it's only worse in a second viewing.  Why not replace it with a giant Skynet tank instead?  Why not a whole group of T-600's out to capture human prisoners?  This giant just feels out of place here.<br /><br />Yet, despite it's stumbling, "Salvation" does get a few things right.  The overall mood and art design of the film, with it's shades of greys, blacks, and blues, does an excellent job creating a post apocalyptic world, and I did like the idea of showing us what the war between man and machine looked like before the technology of lasers and time travel is created.  Sam Worthington does a good job of conveying the tough, yet confused Marcus, and Anton Yelchin is outstanding as a young Kyle Reese, and is easily the best actor of the film, making you believe that he really is a young version of Michael Biehn.  It's also a nice treat that Linda Hamilton returned to do voice overs for John's famous audio tapes.  The opening action sequence, an assault on a Skynet Base set amongst dozens of giant satellite dishes, is quite exciting.  But the best part of the film easily comes in the third act, with a cameo appearance by a well known character from the previous films...it's only after this character appears that the film finally becomes really interesting.<br /><br />But in the end, "Salvation" is a disappointing entry into the Terminator franchise.  With it's weak story, weak characters, choppy pacing, and below average to average action sequences, there's really not much to recommend it here.  There are a few good action sequences, and a few good performances by the actors, but that's really it.  Terminator fans will probably get the most out of it, but everyone else should stick to the first three films.
I agree with everything everyone has said. FoX and WB can Kiss my you know what. Way to pull TSCC in favor of Dollhouse, we all saw how that worked out and now hey lets further fray the fan base with their shoving blue ray down our throats to get the movie we really wanted to see. I wish James Cameron had the means to buy his baby back and do this thing right. Screw Fox and WB. I still liked the movie but I'm tired of the Pg-13 ratings and blue ray being forced upon me. I already spent my money on a 300 Dvd collection! Im not building a blue ray collection. Is it better, yeah, but hollywood has made enough money off of me. Thanks for making me hate you more Fox and WB, hope you got what you wanted. I am just one person but I am sure you have just alienated over half of the fans you had left. Good movie poor distribution content.
A few good ideas that were just terribly, terribly executed.<br /><br />The reverse time traveler. I enjoyed that idea. Sam Worthington, con on death row is executed, but before dying signs his life away to Cyberdyne systems, wakes up in the future, and spends it trying to piece together what happened. Cool.<br /><br />Beyond that...what the heck?<br />The first two movies (the REAL terminator movies) had this ever present mood to them. Mass human genocide was coming and there was nothing that they could do about it. People were going to die and it was just...really, depressing and threatening and remained this heavy presence just over the horizon.<br /><br />But with Salvation...the apocalypse comes and...it's no big deal. Apparently much of the military managed to survive (chain of command included)John Connor is just a cog in the system who spouts gibberish over the radio, and... his father from the future is a fun loving, happy go lucky rogue...<br />None of which connects to the previous movies very well.<br /><br />There is no emotional connection in this movie. The characters are just...boring. They're cardboard cut outs of people, people created to serve a purpose, but never given a chance to ever seem like real people. Hot American Indian chick, plot device to show Sam Worthington's character's humanity, and predictably help him out of a tight spot.  John Connor (Christan Bale), auto distrusts all machines which makes no sense given the previous movies. And we can't even go into all of the stupid mistakes that he makes for someone that was trained as a soldier and should know what the terminators are capable of. Bryce Howard playing John Connor's wife... Why does John Connor need a wife? Why does his wife play no conceivable purpose in the story whatsoever other than being there?<br />And could someone please tell me why Common was even in the movie other than he wanted to be? He must have something like 2 lines.<br /><br />I think it's a steaming pile of crap. But I'll admit people have disagreed with me.<br /><br />If you ignore the previous movies and take it as a stand alone. It's okay...maybe. I just feel that the studios have done to terminator what they did with the Aliens franchise. The good writer/director leaves and then the studios go right ahead and f- it up.<br /><br />If you liked Alien vs Predator (all 5 of you) than you might enjoy this movie. The rest stay away...stay far away.
As a fan of the entire Terminator movie series, you would be forgiven for assuming that I would hate this movie. The truth is that I didn't watch this movie hoping it would match the brilliance of the original movies as I knew that simply wasn't going to happen. What we got was not a film that captured the terrifying doomsday essence of what made Cameron's two Terminator films so brilliant. We also didn't even get the cool and slick looking destruction heavy style of the third Terminator film. What we got instead was, what I felt, to be a perfectly captured post-apocalyptic world which contains a marvellous depiction of the human race when faced with what seems as the impossible fight for survival. Director McG has received a lot of doubt about his ability move the Terminator saga into the post-apocalyptic world which we first gained a glimpse of in the first Terminator movie. That doubt had no foundation and what McG presented in the finished piece, although the plot could do with some polishing, was a fantastically frightening environment with some cool effects and worthy acting throughout.<br /><br />The plot sets John Connor in the year 2018. The machine uprising has begun and only small pockets of human resistance movements exist with the soul purposes of surviving and destroying the machine threat. John Connor has finally entered the position he was fated to enter since before he was born and is now the leader of the human resistance. He has encountered the machines before which gives him and his teams the advantage when knowing what they will be put up against as the human/machine war continues. As the resistance fight continues Connors father, Kyle Reese encounters Marcus Wright who we see at the start of the movie receiving lethal injections on death row just before the war begins. Marcus doesn't know what's happened as he woke up in the post-apocalyptic world with no memory of the machine initial attempt at destroying the human race. Marcus quickly partners up with Kyle Reese and a child we know as Star who are also on a mission to find the resistance leader and join the fight. The mystery eventually unfolds and we find out whether Marcus was sent from the future or is merely a survivor of the past and he becomes pivotal in the fight against the machine threat.<br /><br />The film itself was very touch and go throughout. Some parts worked where others didn't but the entire piece presented an enjoyable action movie that doesn't go too much into the fight for survival on the psychological end of things but does retain the aura of desperation that the humans feel in their fight. Christian Bale was surprisingly awful in this and I honestly expected more from a man taking the reigns of the legendary John Connor. Bale presented an ultimately one dimensional character and you had to question his motives of taking the role of this infamous movie character. The mysterious Marcus Wright character, played by the brilliant Sam Worthington is a movie saving character from start to finish. His whole performance is brilliant throughout and manages to drive the plot along successfully with very little to work with in terms of original character depth. Kyle Reese played by the brilliant up and comer Anton Yelchin is also a delightful addition to the movie and adds again a bit of depth to the movies plot. Other supporting cast include Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams and Bryce Dallas Howard as Connor's wife Cate. Also, a cool little cameo piece goes to the delightful Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan who is a Doctor for Cyberdyne Systems and actually turns out to have a more pivotal role.<br /><br />The action is brilliant throughout and with the apparent unbeatable nature of the machines this manages to present quite a daunting aspect to the theatre of the battles that ensue. The scale of the machine warfare is quite disappointing as when we first glimpsed the human/machine war in the first movie, we gained a glimpse of what seemed to be a constantly chaotic battle which left us wanting more. This film doesn't use Cameron's image as McG takes away the futuristic lasers and hoards of machines lined up executing human after human and he exchanges it for the odd flying scouting machine, a large harvester robot which merely collects the humans for what seems to be mass slaughter and of course, the T-600 machines which are a less advanced model of the T-800 machine which we all know as the 101 machine or Arnold Schwarzenegger who we all miss from this movie. This is probably what the movie is lacking the most as the absence of Arnie is certainly a drag for the Terminator franchise and I'm sure that if the effort were put into the writing, they could have found a role for the older Arnold in this film.<br /><br />There's not denying that Terminator Salvation lacks the charm and excitement of its trilogy of predecessors, however, there's a lot that this film brings to the Terminator universe. The possibility of John Connors son, the look at the early models of the Terminator machines and the new machine concepts make it quite enjoyable. Had the acting been a bit better and the supporting cast a higher level of significance, this film could have been on par with the original 3. It's still a good film and a worthwhile waste of just under two hours.
How bad can a Terminator movie with Christian Bale (AND Sam Worthington), a big budget, and access to modern special effects be?<br /><br />Pretty darn bad.<br /><br />It plays like a cheesy Mad Max movie - except it wasn't produced in Australia with a then-unknown brand new actor and a low budget in the '70's.<br /><br />The key "reveal" of the movie is thrown away almost accidentally. No psychological, wonder if, wonder what, build up. No doubt or surprise when a team member switches sides. In short, these days even comic books are much deeper.<br /><br />Don't get me started about the young actor who plays Kyle Reese, John Connor's future time traveling father. He was completely unsuited to the role! (But played an excellent "Chekhov" in the Star Trek reboot the same year.)<br /><br />I won't say don't waste your money on it. But don't have much in the way of high expectations.<br /><br />And stand in awe of James Cameron, who with spit for budget kicked off this series in the first place, with the low budget, but high impact, original Terminator.
T4 is a film that had so much potential but sadly barely fails to deliver. I love the imagery of the film, the smoky, grimy dirtiness of everything, the decaying city vistas. The acting was actually good, not on the level of T2 but still well enough to keep the audience absorbed in the film. Sam Worthington in his American debut, even though he had already filmed `Avatar', steals the movie from Christian Bale.<br /><br />Salvation lacks something. We get see the T-600 models of the Terminators, but we don't get to see them in full force, only three or four personal encounters and not a full on battle in the post nuclear wasteland. It's not an actual war movie and that's what Terminator fans wanted to see, full on early battles between humanity and Skynet that were hinted at in the first two films, but instead we only get commando raids that begin and end the movie with formulaic action sequences in between.<br /><br />We also don't see John Conner lead. He's either being bossed around by command or working with a small number. It's Marcus who's the real star and a far more interesting story. A criminal gets the needle in ought three suddenly wakes up fifteen years later in the middle of a destroyed laboratory and must figure out what the hell is going on and becomes horribly freaked out when he discovers that he's actually just a heart and a brain inside a synthetic body.
Like many Terminator fans, I was highly skeptical of this film's genuineness. After all, when films change hands, many times the real flow gets lost in the other director's point of view or a prematurely finished film. "Salvation" surprisingly doesn't stray too far from what I would call the genuineness of the storyline. A few spots make you cringe a bit because the lines "come with me if you want to live" and "there's no fate by what we make" are regurgitated in the film. However even though the first half was hard to get into, by the time the movie is 3/4 done, you are sucked in completely. This is not anything like the other Terminator movies, as it is based in the present, not in the past...and it's more of a sci-fi war film than a story-based sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />The appearance of the Arnold-looking T-800 towards the end nails it down. The first T-800 appears, and it immediately hones in on John Connor. It is indestructable and incredibly merciless. A wonderful foreshadowing of the human-cyborg terminators.<br /><br />Details are well-scripted, even to the very detail of John Connor's face getting scarred by the Terminator's nails (compare his scars in Terminator 2 at the beginning, when Commander John Connor is lowering his binoculars). The rescue of young Kyle Reese was wonderful, but the introduction of Kyle made him look like a street rat who steals things and vandalizes. All with his little black kid side kick.<br /><br />I would have appreciated a little more depth, a way to get to know the characters better so you can really connect. This is obviously missing when compared to the work of Cameron in the first two installments.<br /><br />Story-wise this film is incredible. Compared to the other Terminator films however I was expecting more. It always seems that it would be the new director's point of view on how it really should be.<br /><br />I think the new director did a good job on this film. Kudos.
Great movie, everything I expected for a continuation of the Terminator story, and then some.  Very well done.  Highly entertaining.  The ONLY flaw is when they introduced Arnold S's terminator model (T101?)... it was clearly computer generated and looked a little fake, but not too bad.  (Humans ARE hard to do in CG, so...)  That aside, this was a GREAT movie.
Much better than I had heard from others. Just goes to prove that you shouldn't let others opinions influence you. This was a very enjoyable movie.
This is a great addition to the Terminator series. Great story line which sets it post Judgement Day in Western California(Los Angeles, San Francisco, places in between) But was actually all filmed in Arizona which helped with the barren desert landscape design. You also really get a good look at the many designs of machines in this film which James Cameron didn't have the time to get into detail in Judgement Day. T-1s, T-600s, T-700s, T-800s, Hunter Killers, Moto-Terminators, The Harvester, you name it...this movie has it. Now actorwise, Christian Bale(The Dark Knight) as John Conner is for sure a lot better than the guy who played John in Rise of the Machines, very bad ass with a REAL desire to kill the machines and save his father, Kyle Reese played by Anton Yelchin(Star Trek). Then...finally...Sam Worthington(Avatar) as Marcus Wright...oh my god...I tell you, if Sam Worthington didn't play this role I don't know who would have. In 2003 Marcus Wright is on death row for killing 2 cops and his brother, he donates his body to Cyberdyne after his execution for experiments. He is then awakened in 2018 as a one of a kind infiltration prototype terminator which befriends an A-10 pilot, Blair Williams played by Moon Bloodgood(Street Fighter) and a love story forms after Marcus saves her multiple times. You will find out that Marcus Wright is the key to get John Connor into Skynet to save his father from being terminated. This talented aussie actor really did a break out role in this film and is my personal favorite character. This film has non stop action, amazing actors, and great effects to make this personally one of the best Terminator films yet.
I was reading some bad reviews about this movie, and I was a bit amazed.<br /><br />The CGI to me it was pretty good, at least I liked it better than the Terminator 3 CGI...<br /><br />Some people said it had many plotholes but I really didn't see them, we didn't know much about the story about Kyle and John becoming a leader, etc...<br /><br />Some of the reviews I read were also complaining for things they either didn't understand or didn't pay enought attention, or simply didn't know some things and just criticized for the sake of it.<br /><br />One HUGE mistake that I notice constantly that people make, is when they go to see a movie with a preovious expectation...<br /><br />If you go to see a movie thinking it's going to be awesome (or at least thinking it might be similar to "something") you're probably gonna exit the theater dissapointed... As how it happens if you don't know what to expect of a movie and you end up liking it (sometimes you go see a movie thinking it will suck and when you finish it, you keep thinking the same, but that's just the mistake of going to see that movie with a fixed expectation of failure)<br /><br />Overall I liked the movie, the acting wasn't anything amazing, but it was enough for this movie, and the story of Marcus I found it to be interesting and well adapted into the idea of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, I think that people who went to see this movie and didn't like it is because they were expecting another terminator, like the previous ones, or simply was expecting to be dissapointed and got what they hoped for, but still it's a good story, maybe not a huge story, but an important part of the mythology IMO, it added new things to our knowledge, it confirmed others and just played with information we already knew just for the viwer's pleasure...
This movie was the best movie I have seen in a while.  I will just leave it at that.  The ending you get a very cool surprise.  Can't really explain why it's good but if you like action movies and Terminators then this is the movie for you.
loved this movie.  this is one of those that'll stay in my collection.  cant wait for the next one.
I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MOVIE RECIEVED THE SHORT END OF THE STICK,ITS MY FAVORITE TERMINATOR MOVIE.GREAT ACTING ,ANTON YELCHIN ,BRICE DALLAS HOWARD,MOON BLOODGOOD,CHRISTIAN BALE,SAM WORTHINGTON,GREAT ACTORS ,,STORY & MCG DID AN AWESOME JOB.I HOPE THEY WILL MAKE ANOTHER ...BUT MOST LIKELY NOT IT TOOK OVER 2 YRS TO COME OUT .SOMETIMES PEOPLE CANT GET OVER THE ORGINAL ,I HOPE MORE PEOPLE SEE THIS MOVIE & RELISE JUST HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS
Actually, I've never watched the movie - but my oldest son had it on his wish list for Christmas. The ONLY place I found it (Director's Cut, Digital Copy) was on Amazon.
I found this movie to be very good, especially since it finally brought the franchise out of the present day and into the future. Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington give excellent performances. The action and special effects are great. The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film. Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately, but they forget that it has always been Skynet's goal to kill Connor, not Reese, and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor's father.
This DVD is heavy on the special effects and light on the plot. Having seen all of the terminator movies, there has been a downward spiral since "The Governator" left the scene. Given the economic state of California, who knows, maybe he will "be back" as promised. On the other hand, Terminator the TV Series is excellent. Much better than the movies. The scripts are written very well with a great deal of novel ideas worked into the plot that are technologically sound. For example, the notion that sophisticated traffic management systems could be the precursor to the terminator's nervous system was an inspired parallel.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO43M">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQR3J4">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray</a>] The writers of the TV series have clearly done their homework as well as providing creative plot lines that hold the viewer's attention any loyalty. The movie scripts are, for the most part hack jobs with Terminator Salvation serving as an arch-typical illustration. The whizzbang is fine, but there needs to be a bit more substance behind the plot.
For Terminator Fans, of which I am one, this was an entertaining movie.  It was a fun movie to watch on a slow weekend evening. It was the best of the recent man vs. machine genre movies.  There is now a platform for rebuilding the franchise now that previous casts have moved on to other things.
After becoming a blockbuster series in the making with the one-two punch of "The Terminator" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", the burgeoning franchise went on an extended hiatus at the height of its popularity. Then, in 2003, director Jonathan Mostow took over the reins from departing director James Cameron ("The Terminator" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day") with "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" which delivered to us the opening salvo of the escalating war with the machines. Now, here we are six years later with yet another new director as the much maligned (at least by me) filmmaker McG throws us headlong into the conflict with the surprising, yet extremely entertaining and satisfying follow-up "Terminator: Salvation".<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" begins in the year 2018, the machines have almost completely taken over the entire planet, and only small pockets of human resistance remain intact. Led by an almost messianic soldier named John Connor (Christian Bale), the humans begin to rally together for a pivotal battle that could bring the devastating war to a swift conclusion. However, a recent addition to the rabble, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), presents Connor and the rest of the resistance with a mystery that could either spell certain doom for humanity or be the secret weapon they so desperately need.<br /><br />Truth be told, I wasn't sure how good this movie would be prior to its release. The reason for my uncertainty towards this installment had nothing to do with the previous film in the series being somewhat weaker, and everything to do with this movie's director, McG.<br /><br />To me McG is nothing more than a hack director with only one good movie to his name. His first two films had been the insipidly crafted and overblown "Charlie's Angels" movies. Granted he did follow those up three years later with the amazingly sound, heartfelt and moving football drama "We Are Marshall". But when it comes to his more action oriented movies, I think one would be hard-pressed to find an original idea in his head. A fact which the director almost seems proud of as he has referred to his blatant copying as paying an homage rather than ripping off other directors and their movies.<br /><br />However, as I alluded to earlier, "Terminator: Salvation" proved my mistrust of McG's directorial prowess to be somewhat misplaced. Unlike his previous action work where overblown action scenes featuring extremely exaggerated stunt and wire work became very annoying , this film is a grittier, hard-hitting, and dare I say, more realistic style of filmmaking (which may be hard to believe given that this is a sci-fi movie). Also, there are no ridiculously long drawn out slow-motion shots lingering on any of the female characters flipping their hair all around for no good reason (&agrave; la the "Charlie's Angels" movies).<br /><br />Now, this isn't to say that McG resisted his apparently insatiable temptation to steal ideas from other movies. In fact, there are numerous instances sprinkled throughout this film where it is quite obvious what movie he chose to base a large majority of his action sequences upon. If you've seen the movie or even just some of the previews, then you should know exactly to what film I am referring.<br /><br />Numerous times over the course of the movie, several scenes involving the Terminators, or portions of them, blatantly ripped off camera angles or just the style of shooting from Michael Bay's "Transformers". These moments don't detract from the movie too much, because I know that by now almost every new thing a director can come up with has been done in some form or fashion; thus, complete originality is difficult to come by. That being said, I just wish that some of the inspiration hadn't been so painfully obvious even to the most casual of viewers. Here's a thought, maybe next time McG should try not to rip off a movie that has a sequel in theaters only a month or so after his movie. Due to the closeness of the release dates, McG's copying looks less like an homage and more like somebody trying to cheat off of someone else's work to get better results.<br /><br />Despite borrowing visual effects ideas from "Transformers", that doesn't mean the effects in "Terminator: Salvation" were anything to sneeze at. The work done by the creative minds at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) was superbly crafted and not surprisingly, the best the series had seen thus far. The inclusion of multiple new Terminator vehicles, models, and so on was very exciting, especially from the standpoint of not only a fan of the series, but a fan of visual effects. If you have ever spent time watching the first three "Terminator" movies and wished that you could see more of the vehicles shown in the segments chronicling the future war or see even more Terminators in action, then this movie is definitely the one to see as it delivers on both counts.<br /><br />In regards to the cast of this film, we find an all-new assemblage of talent making their debut within the series. Leading the new grouping is the intense character actor Christian Bale ("The Dark Knight") as the leader of the human resistance, John Connor. Not surprisingly, Christian hands in a solid performance, giving us a John Connor that is tough as nails on the outside; however, behind closed doors he still struggles with doubt and despair. These quieter moments with Connor are vital to the character by showing us more than a one-dimensional caricature of a hero, and also to illustrate that he hasn't become cold and calculating like the machines he fights. Not to mention, these reflective scenes also serve as a connection to the decidedly more insecure variation of the character from the previous installment (as portrayed by Nick Stahl). Thankfully though, most of the whining and "Woe is me" attitude that permeated Nick's performance is nowhere to be found in this film.<br /><br />In the primary supporting role, which one could argue is also a lead role in truth, is up-and-coming actor Sam Worthington. As a rising star Sam is in surprisingly high demand with roles not only in this film, but also in James Cameron's "Avatar" and the upcoming remake, "Clash of the Titans". Based on what I've seen of Sam's acting prowess (which is based solely on this movie as I haven't seen "Avatar" yet), I would say as far as an action star goes, he should do very well. He's mastered the steely gaze of previous action heroes such as, Sylvester Stallone or even Arnold; he appears comfortable in action sequences (some newcomers can appear unconfident in their early work); and lastly, he has a presence on screen that captures the audience's attention. As far as his dramatic skills, well that remains to be seen, but at least he should have a decent enough future in the action genre if nothing else.<br /><br />Rounding out the remainder of the supporting players are Bryce Dallas Howard ("Spider-Man 3"), Anton Yelchin ("Star Trek"), and Moon Bloodgood ("Pathfinder"). Bryce Dallas Howard is given very little to do in her role as John's wife Kate. She is relegated to merely reacting to John's struggles with his doubts or being the strong supportive wife in front of the troops. Moon Bloodgood as Blair, one of John's faithful soldiers, is given more to do than Bryce; however, even then she spends most of her time in action sequences. So, no real depth is given to her character other than that she is an extremely competent fighter.<br /><br />When you look at the characters of Kate and Blair one definitely gets the sense that the writers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris ("Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines") were simply giving a taste of these ancillary characters and that more time would be spent exploring them in future sequels. So with that thought in mind, I say here's hoping for more on these potentially interesting characters in the future.<br /><br />Lastly, actor Anton Yelchin gets the second most fleshed out supporting role behind Sam Worthington as a young resistance fighter named Kyle Reese. Anton brings an earnest quality to Kyle that harkens back to Michael Biehn's portrayal of an older version of the character in the original film. At the same time, Anton displays a youthful enthusiasm to prove one's self worth in a world of humanity comprised almost entirely of soldiers. Throughout this movie I noticed numerous subtle references to either character traits/mannerisms or phrases that Kyle would say that were reminiscent of the previous movies as well (the same can also be said for John Connor too). It's these little nods and insider references to characters and/or events from throughout the series' history that makes the experience all the more enjoyable for me as I try to catch each one.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that I entered this movie with numerous doubts regarding just how good it could be; I must say that the end result is an incredibly fun, fast-paced, action-packed ride that will leave you wanting more. This installment definitely overcomes the weaker points of the previous film (which was still a good movie in itself) and propels this series forward to deliver even more excitement in the future.<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" is available in a PG-13 Theatrical Cut or R-rated Director's Cut; both feature violence and language, with brief nudity in the Director's Cut only.
To give you an idea where I stand with the Terminator franchise, I give T1 and T2 5 stars and T3 3 stars... This film was gritty like the first with a fresh and new direction. This time dealing with the months and years after "Judgment day" John Connor is finding the path that will ultimately lead him to save humanity. It easily out shined the 3rd installment and kept on pace with the first 2. An easy 3.5-4 star review..... I can't wait for Mc G's next story arch...
I'm a big Terminator fan, and I loved this one no less.  Sam Worthington did a great job.  I even thought Christian Bale did a good job.  Seen in many times and will watch it many more.  "Come with me if you want to live......"
I can't believe these reviews turned into rants, never knew so many people cared about the extra features. Anyway, to address the issue at hand, I happen to think that Terminator is the greatest movie franchise of all time (sorry Star Wars nerds). James Cameron did a great job on T1 and T2 and Salvation was a fantastic addition to his masterpiece (lets not mention T3). The only things missing from Salvation are the constant chase vs escape feelings and the confusion over how events fit in the puzzle of time. There are also a lot more depictions of other humans involved in the war, John Connor is not a hero yet. True fans of Terminator will notice several references to the previous editions, which I found to be funny. Note: I might be a little biased because Christian Bale is my favorite actor. Sam Worthington was pretty good too. Ok, so that's my review. I bought this movie and I still watch the other 2 on Netflix periodically.
I was disappointed in this sequel, tho the special effects and most action was terrific. The plot was disjointed and the characters unclear to me. The ending was predictable early on, and was a clone of "I Robot." The film's monotone coloration was depressing, and the Terminators stereotypic - including their menacing growls (huh?) and skeletal teeth (they eat hot dogs?) The attempt to weave in Arnold S. at the end and reproduce the molton-steel gimmick (Terminator 2)felt disjointed and like an afterthot.<br />Save your money.
Well, the movie was fun and it was great to see Arnold, well kinda, back as the character that started it all. The movie is well worth watching and the picture is awsome. The so called director's cut, leaves alot to be desired. The rating is changed to an "R" because of 3 minutes that are lame and could have been more. We see a all to brief view of Williams breast, and, I do mean brief and from the side. This does NOT improve the movie or add anything to the plot. I am happy that this version came with the set, if, I bought this version for the extra scene it would have been a big let down. I hope that a version with more extra scenes is released soon.
Got to me quick and before the scheduled Time.  Okay movie.  Plot is weak.  Action good.
This was one of the best terminator movie yet, evryone play their part and it was just a sit down and enjoy yorself type moive, I Recommend this movie to anyone that like action pack and hold on to the edge of your set movie.
&lt;&lt;SPOILER>>  &lt;&lt;SPOILER>>  &lt;&lt;SPOILER>>  &lt;&lt;SPOILER>>  &lt;&lt;SPOILER>><br /><br />Short_N_Sweet: a mindless string of action sequences w/exceedingly little dialogue/plot development. A two hour film filled w/too ridiculous to believe stunts. The kicker is Connor getting a 2" wide steel bar rammed through his spinal column, & supposedly his heart. It's OK, though... He still walks w/assistance to a far away helicopter, undergoes emergency cardio-thoracic surgery in the dusty wide open desert. Then receives a heart transplant... Yeah, suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. Bale was great in Batman. His performance here is uninspired & flat. This film is way too short on character/plot substance, & far too laden w/mindless action. I'm glad I only wasted $3.00 on a rental.
Skynet becomes aware in 2003 and all hell breaks loose. Machines make the Earth their stomping ground for the next 18 years, while humans find themselves hunted and terminated by specially built machines. All the while, John Connor fights alongside of the Resistance, making certain that the "prophecy" about his future comes true. Skynet also knows about this prediction and begins taking measure to stop this by hunting him and Kyle Reese to keep Judgment Day's purty end machine-based, building all sorts of interesting things into this now 15-year-old storyline. Then there's Marcus, the sub, the signal, and a few dozen other things that are best left to the movie to describe.<br /><br />Out of all of the Terminator movies, i have to say that i liked this one the best. Instead of having one machine going after one person, we finally have the future that we had been promised. Sure, this isn't far enough for Connor to get his wings and take out the net, but it does show just how far he''s come. Scenes like those with him meeting high command also show how much skepticism is going around about him and his supposed future, but that doesn't seem to bother him. The thing he worries about is Kyle and meetting him, not to mention the fact that Skynet has the two of them on a kill list. and then there's Marcus - something that he doesn't have the slightest notion how to deal with.<br /><br />One of the things i liked about the movie were the different types of machines that Skynet had built. It has collection machines, Hunter/Killers patrolling the sky, machines to kill all foot traffic, things on the road, and T-600s everywhere. We are just now up to the T-800 launch as well, and we are just now up to Skynet beginning its "dark times." so, humanity still has a fighting chance when battling and it isn't like the first movie. The fields of skulls may exist somewhere but, along with those, the humans have A-10 Warthogs and other weapons. This makes for some good fights, some interesting moral dilemmas, and some themes I wasn't expecting. It seemed like a thinking person's skynet, which I thought was interesting in the making.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series I figure you will go here anyhow. People who do not like it may want to check it out anyhow because this movie is different. It breaks a lot of cyclical bonds while still keeping the story, making it interesting. Personally, I liked it above all the others, and I even remember the first through a child's eyes - and it was something else. Recommended and then some.
I keep seeing a lot of people calling the 3rd movie "campy", and the 2nd "the best". I think these are just everyday movie goers saying things like that. Fans of the series who like action will like T2 the best, but fans more into horror say the 1st will never be beaten. Terminator: Salvation will be closer to the first film than the other two. I like this movie more than the 2nd and 3rd. The 2nd has the James Cameron aura around it that has everyone charmed. And even though the 3rd was filled with action and "over the top" machine on machine battles, it comes in 4th. I still wake up from nightmares of a blown in half Terminator crawling after me where ever I am, so the first is 1st on my list. Terminator: Salvation is full of the things that will only make my nightmares worse. James Cameron zombies are giving this movie low ratings to keep it down. If you are more of a fan of the First Terminator, this one might make you feel good.
I'll agree with other reviewers that this will probably be a movie most will either love or hate. Personally, I loved the movie and thought it was a great followup to the other Terminator movies. Be warned, however, that if you go into this movie expecting it to be like the past films- well, you be the judge. Whereas the other films dealt with alot of storyline about the Terminators, Cyberdine and Skynet; this film does very little to push that envelope along. In its' place, all we see are alot of action sequences with different types of machines and some Terminator action but not alot. Other than that, the cast was well chosen with all giving solid performances.<br /><br />The story takes place in 2018. Judgment Day has come and gone. John Conner is hard at work trying to convince the rest of the world that he is the key to their salvation from the Terminators. Marcus Wright is a death row prisoner who submits his body to experiments as penance for crimes he has committed(yet only hinted at in the movie). Awaking in 2018, Marcus discovers that the world has been destroyed and is no longer as he remembers it. Along his way, he meets up with Kyle Reese and that's where the movie pretty much starts.<br /><br />While I think Termintor Salvation is a great movie, it was pretty much done in McG's over the top style of filmmaking that he did in Charlie's Angels/Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle.
No!  This is not ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S Terminator.  And NO, James Cameron's hand was not involved directly with this film.  The lore of the Terminator Franchise has actually grown beyond requiring Arnold's presence or James Cameron's input, although a very good CG version of a younger & buff Governator DOES appear in the film.  I was ecstatic that we FINALLY got to see Chapters from the war of the last remnants of humanity against the machines, whereas the other films only teased us with brief glimpses of the conflict.  THIS storyline sets the stage for FUTURE chapters.  While THIS Terminator movie lacks some of the tounge & cheek dialogue that the previous movies contained, it is JUST as good in terms of action, mission, storyline, & acting performances, especially from the newcomer, Sam Worthington, who portrays Marcus Wright and actually has as much if not, more screen time than Christian Bale.<br />I actually wondered if Christian Bales' on set tirade or political maneuvering not only resulted in lackluster reviews for THIS movie by the "Critics", but also resulted in the cancelling of one of the most intelligent and action packed sci-fi series to come along since "Firefly", "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles".  Unfortunately, it ENDED with the same results.  A show "TERMINATED" before its time.  I'm just glad that we will at least see another installation of this film franchise, as this movie was contracted along with a sequel.  I thought McG did an excellent job and I look forward to seeing what he does with the next instalment!<br /><br />If you enjoy the Terminator franchise, you will most likely enjoy this movie too.  It's not as good as T2, but IMO is a lot better than the 3rd movie.  I gave Terminator Salvation 5 stars because its a movie that I will watch and enjoy many times over, not necessarily because its the best Terminator movie.  I also like the fact that the Director's cut is INCLUDED instead of being repackaged 3 times (like "Watchmen") and the extras are cool too.
The film is in no danger of ever becoming a classic, but it was much better than I had expected. It had some goofy moments and some<br />really blatant ripoffs of earlier films, but by modern hollyweird standards that`s not half bad. Most are far worse.<br />Unlike most recent sci-fi films that hollyweird has inflicted on the public, this one at least had a plot even if it was a fairly<br />predictable one and a story line that at least mostly made sense.<br />How far entertainment has fallen in the last few years. Here I am praising a film because it`s not nearly as bad as most of the<br />trash put out in the last few years.
I really enjoyed Terminator 4 aka Terminator Salvation, and I hope that if Terminator 5 comes out, it has all the future scenes from Terminator, T2, and T3. This was a radical movie. I got to see new forms of robots that Skynet created. I thought that this movie was a nice departure from bad cyborg-good cyborg fights. it was cool to see Roland Kickinger with a CGI of Arnold's face, as Arnold played a T-800 in all 3 Terminator movies. it was freaky how the cyborg gun turret recognized Marcus Wright, but did not shoot at him, because it knew that he was a Terminator cyborg. it didn't matter to me that Arnold was not in this movie, because I got a good thrill out of it none the less.
As expected, the special effects were, well, special. Unfortunately, after the special effects, there apparently was not enough money left to pay for a 14 year-old to point out the glaring errors in the script - my favorite was when the 6 story-tall robot that shook the earth when it walked and was accompanied by a jet plane, snuck up on the people in the desert quick-trip.<br />The script also failed to close the loop and send Kyle back to save Sarah.<br />The basic problem is that somebody other than James Cameron was allowed to direct the sequel Terminator movies. The second one was not terrible, but the T3 and Salvation were way off from what they could have been.
This movie never really never got the credit it deserved at the box office.  This is a really good action flick.  My husband said it was the best movie he'd seen in a long time (and we watch a lot of movies).  It's got non-stop edge-of-your-seat action, and I thought Christian Bale was GREAT as John Connor.  Newcomer Sam Worthington was good in this, too.  If you read the reviews, you'll see what's driving the number of stars down is the fact that people don't like it that there are extras on the blu-ray version, but not the regular dvd version.  This movie gets five stars from me.
I waited till Dec 1 to buy this and it was AWESOME! This movie had all the elements of the Terminator movies, it had the cyborg tracking John, it had the Terminator chase scenes (again and again), it had the fiery Terminator factory end scene, YES!, it had Arnie as the Terminator and he looked very, very close to how he looked in T1/T2, it had Sarah Connor, the music, the story, the director, it was all pieced together so well and Bale makes it so believable with his angry acting, just awesome. BUY IT!
I'm a big fan of everything 'Terminator' (own everything on DVD or Blu-Ray) - but this film is a major disappointment.  It has one good action sequence early in the film (though even that steals ideas from Transformers).  The big action sequence at the end is nothing more than Terminator 1's end action scene all over again, right down to the 'Help me, John!' lure by the terminator.  I went in with low expectations, which usually means I can be pleasantly surprised by any redeeming qualities.  There weren't many, in the case of this film.  Sam Worthington plays a character worth watching though.  Christian Bale's character was drab and uninteresting.  (Let's hope he didn't mean it when he said he would be back!)
When I heard that Christian Bale was starring in the newest TERMINATOR film, I flipped.  I mean, Bale's portrayal of Batman (or, rather, Bruce Wayne; I have qualms about his Batman voice, but that's another rant) helped rejuvenate the ailing franchise...hell, it brought it back from the grave.  I figured he could do the same for TERMINATOR as well, a series that started strong, became excellent, and then fizzled in the third entry.<br /><br />Well...SALVATION is much stronger than TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.  However, Bale isn't given much to work with--his character, John Connor, wasn't even the principle character in the original script.  SALVATION rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Sam Worthington, who thankfully is an actor worthy of the challenge.  Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a death-row inmate given a second chance as one of SkyNet's failed human/cyborg composites.  However, the film wavers between Bale and Worthington's characters, primarily because the studio knows that ignoring a big-name star like Christian Bale is a big no-no.  Dare I say it: this movie would have been stronger without Bale's presence.  (I know, it's almost blasphemous; but it's the truth.)<br /><br />Also along for the ride is the talented Anton Yelchin (who also hit 2009 blockbuster gold in STAR TREK), as the guy who eventually goes back in time and sleeps with Connor's mother (look for voice cameos by Linda Hamilton).  We've also got a grossly under-used Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Ironside; Moon Bloodgood, who's a good fit for the role, although again there's not much to work with; and Bryce Dallas Howard, who doesn't quite mesh with the action stars she's surrounded with.  Add to that McG's uneven direction, and TERMINATOR: SALVATION comes off as another "what it should have been" film--not great, not spectacular, but entertaining enough to make up for RISE OF THE MACHINES.  Of course, that wouldn't take very much.  Also, let's face it: we would've loved a genuine Arnold cameo, his old age be damned.  Now THAT would have been true salvation.
many of the old fan hates this movie. I am young fan and like the war of future. terminator Sarah Connor chronicles made me a fan. There so much to take advantage of.  If have not watch the trailer this movie should more thrilling.  The moives does have it flaws like john Conner's wound at the end. Also it the main character Marcus really helps make the movie.
I saw this movie with my son, and it is nothing like the other movies but make a little bit of sense to me but I think it could have been a hell of alot better with fighting sequence and special effets. I understand why sam worthington is a terminator because of my states gov. not being able to film in it but yet they use the cg versiion of him, that was cool. on the other hand I think they should bring worthingtons caracter back for the next movie and give him more of a role as well as other cast members . and find someone other than christan bale.....
In terms of big Hollywood movies, I feel like there are 2 kinds of bad movies: (1) There's the type of bad movie that has the sheen of being good just b/c it has an A-list director and actors and smothers the viewer with big words and an overly "serious" tone and lots of emoting, but deep down is as empty as an abandoned building, for example, THE DARK KNIGHT! That movie is nothing and I freely gave it only 1 star. (2) Then there's the type of bad movie that is so in-your-face BAD that it can't be denied and TERMINATOR SALVATION is THAT movie! Ironically, both movies star Christian Bale (who plays John Connor in this) and guess what? There's a strong connection, b/c just like in TDK, in TERMINATOR SALVATION, Bale also uses the SAME raspy voice again...WOW!<br /><br />I knew TERMINATOR:SALVATION (TS for short) was doomed from the start, opening in 2003 (pre-apocalypse) with a character and story that seemed totally disconnected from all the previous Terminator films. And I KNEW that in the end, the explanation would not make any sense and be a total violation of all that had been established in the first 3 Terminator movies: just another fancy Hollywood gimmicky "twist" ending designed for shock value, and it wasn't even that shocking as the "twist" had already been spoiled in the trailers. This character is condemed criminal Marcus Wright (played by newcomer Sam Worthington) and the movie opens with him on death row about to be executed, but not before he signs away his body to be donated to a cancer-stricken Cyberdyne scientist (played by Helena Bonham Carter).<br /><br />The post title scene introduces us to John Connor (Bale) and I've got to say that I think that Bale is the WORST portrayal of John Connor in all the films! I actually didn't like Furlong that much in T2 as he was cliche, but I think Bale is worse than the kid. Nick Stahl in T3 is the best portrayal by far. Bale spends the whole movie rasping, grunting, yelling, "thinking" and it is annoying to watch. In fact, I dare say that Bale himself seems to almost be in a separate movie from everyone else...that is how disconnected his story is. While all other actors feel like part of the movie (albeit not a very good one!), Bale appears to be in his own world above all the proceedings.<br /><br />Worthington's Marcus Wright is the real main character and the movie tracks his story until it intersects with Connor's, leading to the climax and conclusion. Wright's tale is the standard by-the-numbers fare with him trying to find the source of his troubles in 2018 post-apocalyptic California. Along the way, he meets the basic crew of cliche characters: the scrappy, green teenager who needs a push in the right direction Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, who actually gives a good performance among a sea of bad ones!), the little girl who doesn't speak (Newt from ALIENS, anyone?), the hot, tough-as-nails female who can take care of herself (Moon Bloodgood, obviously a fashion model in real life!), etc. Worthington is just OK as Wright, but he doesn't have to speak much. He plays the typical monosyllabic summer action movie hero who is more brawn than brains. In fairness to him and all the actors, the dialogue is atrocious and the plot thin.<br /><br />Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter who seems to get a lot of thankless roles) plays John's wife Kate Brewster Connor (character was introduced in T3 played convincingly by Clare Danes). An issue I had was with the age of Kate...In T3, Kate was to be in her early-to-mid-20s or so, but in TS, it is now 15 years later and Howard actually looks younger than Danes did in T3?! I even think Bale is a little too young-looking to play Connor. In fact, all the characters are too "clean" in appearance to be living in indefinite subhuman conditions. And Bale and Howard don't have near the chemistry that Stahl and Danes did in T3. In T3, even in the short span of time it was set, the John-Kate relationship was convincingly established, but here they seem like complete strangers just thrown together and they've been together for 15 FREAKIN YEARS!<br /><br />Also, where is the colorful, evocative, eternal nighttime setting that was so well-established in the future flashback/flashforward montages in all the previous Terminator films? In TS, 99.9% of the scenes are daylight and the cinematography is very off-putting and dreary-looking. Not to mention that the human resistance seems to have an endless supply of weapons to fight what few Terminators we get to actually see! There's supposed to be armies of machines, but instead, we get conveniently timed Terminators (one of which looks suspiciously like a robot from TRANSFORMERS!) and most of which look to be different in design...I thought all the early models (the T600s) were supposed to look the same?<br /><br />The biggest faux pas though involves the subplot (or main plot, not sure which!) of Kyle Reese (who really shouldn't be introduced this soon) and why Skynet even knows of the connection between him and John Connor. Also, I found the climactic action scenes at Skynet uninteresting and convoluted, including how it was so easy for Connor to infiltrate the facility with little resistance (the sole purpose of machines is to track humans 24 hours a day but they can't take out ONE human in their own headquarters?) and of course the not-so-shocking revelation about Wright and his predictable actions thereafter.<br /><br />TS, in general, just seems to be a patched together flick with big budget special effects (that aren't that impressive to me), a franchise-killing plot, and terrible dialogue. I say, "Do-over, please?!"
Besides all of the regular broken things you hear about this movie...<br /><br />The voice recordings of Sarah Connor were dull and impassive. They sounded like a school teacher discussing apples or oranges for lunch. They lacked a passionate or fiery edge (yes even in their vocies) as shown by Linda Hamilton from T2 or Lena Headey from TSCC? Oh wait, Linda Hamilton's voice was used... and she read her lines how the director wanted her to read them.<br /><br />John Connor did nothing for this story, his parts could have been all in the background and it wouldn't of impacted the storyline in any way.<br /><br />Continuity and Common sense were ignored:<br /><br />Example 1: The T-600 - Kyle Reese said they were covered in rubber skin, which made them easier to spot up close. (Synthetic skin, hair, nails etc. being the last comestic improvements on the Terminator robots - turning them into cyborgs). McG (the director) probably thought he said they were easy to spot because they were 8 or 9 feet tall and had a minigun on one arm. The rubber skin on the movie T-600s was not a disguise at all. It was some rubber sheets draped over their head. I don't honestly believe many pro-wrestlers are EVEN close to being that big or ugly so unless Skynet wanted to infiltrate a Wrestling Federation/Organization it was doing things wrong in Terminator: Salvation.<br /><br />Example 2: The giant machine which scoops up people from buildings like a fat man grabbing pop-corn... How the hell does something that large sneak up on paranoid people in the future? Especially small communes in the middle of nowhere? Was it wearing a rubber sheet with wrestling tights on?<br /><br />It has been reported that when the director McG was asked about this film and how it's not up to any kind of standards that he replied with "it's just a damn dumb summer action, terminator movie, it's not supposed to be cerebral, it's a pop-corn fantasy flick". No wonder Bill Murray punched him out once.<br /><br />If you hated T3 remember this about TS: The first full screenplay for the film was written by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />Based on 250 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, critical reaction for Terminator Salvation tended toward negativity with an overall 32% approval rating. Among Rotten Tomatoes' Top Critics, which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers, websites, television and radio programs, the film holds an overall approval rating of 29 percent. By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 52, based on 35 reviews. At all three websites, the film ranked lowest among the Terminator franchise films.
If you love the Terminator franchise...well, you'd HAVE to love it to endure this mess.  The first two flicks were awesome, of course.  The third?  Not so much.  T4?  The downward spiral continues.  Huge budget, talented actors and great story material are all majestically pissed away.  The Charlie's Angels films were light and fun but McG needed to introduce a bunch of peripheral characters that would have been fine in another film but who cares?  I didn't and that was the problem.  Bryce Howard gets to walk around with big eyes.  Christian Bale gets to play in some over-the-top effects sequences.  Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood(sp?) get to have a romance and why do we need this or care?  All of these people are extremely talented and again, the effects?  More or less spectacular.  But I found myself apathetic.  In the earlier films you found a stake in the characters and cared.  With T4 I felt like I was watching a play by Max Fisher.  Well done but just not the real deal.
Well, there's nothing like destroying a franchise, is there? Take two of science fiction and Hollywood's most beloved movies, remove everything that was ever good about them and flush them down the toilet - and Jim Cameron's not even dead yet. I love - LOVE - the originals and it pains me to watch my adoptive children get the George Lucas treatment. Let me count the ways in which this film will be remembered as one of the bedrock events in the destruction of storytelling and a critical step towards Michael Bay receiving the Nobel Peace prize and Best Screenplay Oscar in 2020.<br /><br />I knew from the beginning it didn't look good from having a director called McG - Mr T was the last three-lettered celebrity I can remember but at least he didn't try to direct a film. When Helena Bonham Carter showed up as the stereotyped terminal cancer patient, I knew we were in trouble. And then Sam Worthington showed up (the Gene Hackman of our times, appearing in about 10% of all films currently being made) and couldn't decide on an American or Australian accent for the duration of the shoot. Fortunately, it's not too noticeable since Christian Bale's Batman growl steals the show.<br /><br />If you can cast your mind back to the legitimate Terminator films, one of the rules is that bullets don't tend to do much damage to Terminators whereas molten steel is a pretty effective way in taking one out. In this film, it's the reverse - Christian Bale takes out a T-800 with a machine gun but fails to destroy one with molten steel. Go figure. And that's the most faithful this film gets to the originals.<br /><br />Then there's a whole bunch of new characters introduced that nobody cares about and they attempt to recycle some of the iconic dialog ("Come with me if you want to live," to which the only response is "If the rest of the film is this bad, I'll stay here.")<br /><br />Back to the bad and broken logic, Skynet is no longer trying to exterminate people but rather farm them for some reason that doesn't make any sense. It turns out that Sam Worthington is 50% Terminator too but by the time we find out, it's no surprise because we saw it in the trailer. More of a surprise is the massive Transformers-style bot that's incredibly bad at catching people. And then there's the even bigger surprise of the motorcycle-shaped Terminator that takes a USB Flash drive - thank God the USB2.0 protocol survived the war.<br /><br />At some point Bryce Dallas Howard shows up, thankful that she's in something marginally better than Lady in the Water. Apparently, Claire Danes is still recovering from embarrassing herself in Terminator 3 and couldn't bring herself to this horror show. I don't really remember why she's there.<br /><br />Anyway, plot-wise we get into some really convoluted plan by the machines that makes the average episode of Murder She Wrote look like Agatha Christie. They build this half-human-slash-cyborg thing to lure out John Connor when the real thing was infinitely more effective (or they could have just killed his father when they held him in the farm). Skynet is apparently running Windows ME since their strategic logic wouldn't win a chess game let alone Future War.<br /><br />The ending - slight SPOILER ALERT here - is so far-fetched I had to rewatch a Christopher Nolan film to bring back my faith in the movie industry. There's a heart transplant surgery that would make a daytime soap opera blush and literally I was ready to head out for a beer when it happened.<br /><br />So sorry for the rant but the first Terminator films are largely responsible for my love of movies and McG just did the worst possible job. Terminator 3 was possible to ignore but Terminator Salvation leaves my brain rocking back and forth in my head trying to make sense of the whole thing. As far as I'm concerned, this story ended perfectly when Arnold was lowered into the molten steel and that's the end of it.<br /><br />If you remember how thrilled you were when first seeing Terminator 2, do yourself a favor and relive that film rather than having it trashed by this one. And I didn't even get to tell you how bad the pointless CGI Arnie looked but apparently it cost a *lot* of money.
It's difficult these days to please a sophisticated world audience.  We've seen it all and it takes a lot to move us, inspire us, make us feel the gamut of emotions and be entertained.  Yet this installment of the Terminator series does just that.  IMHO, it ranks as one of the best epic science fiction movies ever produced.<br /><br />The acting is outstanding, the characters are endearing, compelling and artfully developed.  Christian Bale plays the perfect relentless and conflicted John Connor. Sam Worthington beautifully brings the brave heart of Marcus Wright to life along with the tragic circumstances of his existence.  Moon Bloodgood excels at playing the beautiful Blair Williams a woman with unflinching strength and conviction.  The sweet youthfulness and fearless persona of Anton Yelchin playing a perfect Kyle Reese along with newcomer Jadagrace Berry (Star) together make the perfect complement of innocence contrasting starkly with their life on the bleeding edge.<br /><br />The special effects were first rate, along with the script, sound and pace of the movie.  If you love sci-fi, you're going to love this movie.
Yet again we see one more movie from the Terminator Franchise. Ever since the first Teaser Trailer for Salvation was launched, I had been excited for this movie. Recently there had been very big speculation with this particular Movie, especially by the Critics World. I was surprised to see this movie getting whacked so much by the critics at [...] I have seen this movie at last and I can say this Movie deserved much more than what it received at Rotten Tomatoes. There is no doubt Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the best among the series. But this movie was better than T3: Rise of Machines.<br /><br />When McG signed up for this movie I had been apprehensive because honestly, I hated Charlie's Angels. Terminator Salvation is a new beginning, so we should not compare with its predecessor. There is no time travel and of course no mission for hunting down the members of the Connors. High point of this movie is its action; it has been a long time since I had seen action like this. Special Effects incorporated are top notch. As far as character development is concerned... there are some places where certain elements are missing. Considering this as the start of the trilogy this can be forgiven. I hope this will be dealt with other upcoming series. Columnists have complained that Christian Bale was cold as John Connor. I can say that when the central character has been subjected to so many years of war, we can always expect to hope for less sentiment as that happens in today's reality. Terminator Salvation gyrates round the Character of Marcus Wright (Very well portrayed by Sam Worthington) & Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). This movie was meant to be action oriented so as to show us the apocalyptic world post judgment day. Apart from the stunning cinematography Danny Elfman's music gives us an edgy metallic score.<br /><br />Since so many reviews have already given out the plot details of 'Salvation' I will not be writing it as it ruins the anticipation. Finished with that, closing notes will be every one should see this movie with an open mind rather than having a downbeat feeling for not having Arnold or 'Hasta la Vista, baby'<br /><br />Note: Recently I heard that there might be some forty minutes of edited footage for the upcoming Terminator Salvation DVD. Expectantly it might give us some more details.
This isn't a real movie. There's no storyline, just a bunch of scenes that appear to lurch toward no conclusion whatsoever. No two plot points match, no human motivation appears to animate this cast of losers. No effort at all was expended on anything beyong stealing your money and wasting your time.<br /><br />The unfathomable star power of Christian Bale, whose last credible performance was the lead in Empire of the Sun, was exploited to the hilt here. Bale has evolved perfect mastery of two acting modes, and only two: incoherent muttering and incoherent screaming.<br /><br />If making this dull, stupid movie is the best people can do, Metal deserves to win.
I liked Terminator 1, #2 is one of my all-time favorite movies, #3 was a sad joke, and #4 is a fitting end to a wonderful series.  I liked the little details that tied in and paid tribute to the previous movies: how John Connor got the scar on his face; Bryce-Dallas Howard is a plausible older version of Claire Danes; John's continued love of rock music, etc.  Christian Bale, whatever his faults as a person, is an excellent actor and plays John Connor well.  I think Sam Worthington is overrated as an actor, but he does a decent job in his role.  I think some people over-analyze movies - sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy it for what it is.  A good action movie, good storyline, good acting, and a respectable finale to one of the greatest sci-fi movie franchises ever.
Terminator Salvation<br />2009 / 115 min. / PG-13<br /><br />Synopsis: John Conner (Christian Bale) is fated to lead humanity's war against the machines, but the arrival of a stranger, Marcus Wright, (Sam Worthington) alters the future of mankind.<br /><br />It had been six years since we last saw an installment to the Terminator franchise. That film, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, was viewed as a "disappointment". Since then, a lot had changed. Most notably, Arnold Schwarzenegger walked away from acting to become the Governor of California. So leading into a fourth film, many were concerned if there was even life to the franchise after Arnold.<br /><br />There was a lot at stake with Terminator Salvation, the fourth film in the popular franchise. The huge burden was inexplicably handed over to the Charlie's Angels director, McG. As to be expected, the internet was aghast with the announcement. "How could this guy be the one to carry on the franchise?" Soon after, fans seemed to cool down due to the signing of Christian Bale as John Connor. This casting decision, however, would cause serious havoc to the screenplay penned by Terminator 3 scribes John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris. Connor, who was originally conceived as a small, mystical figure was now required to be sprinkled throughout the entire film causing the characters of Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) to be diminished. Ultimately, this is where it all goes wrong for the film. The script had been raped and pillaged and devoid of what the fans would have expected with such a concept. All we get is wall-to-wall action with very little in between.<br /><br />Christian Bale, who is often cited as being 'terrible' in this film, just simply has nothing really to work with and ultimately, the character of John Connor actually seems to be pretty pointless. The same could be said for Bryce Dallas Howard as his wife Kate. It often feels - as was the case - that these characters were shoehorned in with nothing for them to do. Sam Worthington, however, is really the only interesting thing about the movie. His character may not be great but at least he offers something. In fact, I would have loved to have seen more of the relationship between him and Reese be developed instead of the need for an explosion every two minutes. That is, however, the one good thing that could be said for the film. It certainly has some nice looking effects.<br /><br />The real problem here, as stated earlier, is the script. There's nothing going on, and when there is, it becomes flat out illogical or it contradicts elements of the previous Terminator movies. They do try to appease the die-hards by infusing some nostalgia by incorporating Linda Hamilton's voice, the CGI-Schwarzenegger and throwing in a sampling of the series' classic theme, but despite it all, it never truly feels like a Terminator movie. Many may pin that on its PG-13 rating, but in honesty, an R-rating wouldn't have saved this one. And don't even get me started on the film's ending. Who the hell thought that was a good idea?!<br /><br />Overall, Terminator Salvation is essentially one loud, elongated action sequence that lingers on and on for nearly two hours. It's poorly paced and erratically edited with no substantive dialogue or situations. It's just a flimsy, unoriginal, forgettable film that would have been best left unmade.
If what you look for in a movie is a bunch of generic people spouting a bunch of generic duologue, this is the movie for you!<br /><br />None of the charm, subtlety, depth, or focus of the first two Terminator's (or, dare I say, even the third) survived this adaptation. The locations are stale and lifeless, the people are as robotic and artificial as the CGI robots they're fighting, and only name recognition gives us any indication that this is even related to the original movies. I don't like any of these people, I don't care about any of these people, I'm not interested.<br /><br />In the first three movies we got the sense that the protagonists were running away from a powerful and malevolent menace. Attempting to survive an implacable foe, in order to achieve a goal that meant the difference between humanity's survival and its annihilation. But here, the wooden, generic pod people run from a summer action blockbuster in order to survive long enough to set up another special effects shot.<br /><br />Some lip service is given to the the issue of "identity" "choice" "free will" and "prejudice" but it's underused and unconvincing. It comes off as an attempt to 'remind' the audience that "Terminator" is about ideas, rather than actually presenting them.<br /><br />The most I can say about this movie is that, as you watch it, you will quickly feel (as i did) as though you might as well be watching anything.
Well this is a crying shame. I love Terminator and T2. McG wanted James Cameron's blessing on this film and , proving he is no dummy, Cameron did not give it to him. Smart man. McG came from music videos and it shows. In his own furiously fast fashion this is a love letter to Cameron. There are iconic lines, a weird looking Arnie, Linda Hamilton's voice (sorta), and the actors do what they can with the material; calling it cheesy dialog is an insult to cheese.<br />This isn't Christian Bale's movie, it's Sam Worthington's and he does a fabulous job. Bale is his usual intense self playing a soldier trying to survive and be a leader and a husband without losing his mind.<br />The directing is terrible. Worse than terrible. This isn't "Batman and Robin" or anything, but if you saw the trailer/preview, you saw the movie. And that is a tragedy. Cameron created a series with meat; McG serves you a packaged salad without  dressing and expects you to be happy about it.
The director's cut runs approximately 3 minutes longer, and inserts a few new scenes, but no major plot points.  This is NOT the major unrated cut that McG has referred to in past interviews, where he suggested that 30-40 minutes of additional footage would be added.  We'll probably see that in a future edition.<br /><br />Here are the major differences between the theatrical version and the director's cut (spoilers follow).<br /><br />1) In the opening action scene, when John Connor is leading his unit into the flooded underground Skynet base, a T-1 terminator (nice touch from T3) suddenly appears behind them.  His men destroy it before it can do any damage.  I'm glad this scene was cut; it inadvertently breaks the tension too quickly.<br /><br />2) When John pulls his little "frogman stunt", he is seated before the Resistance Command generals, and General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) berates John.  Ashdown says, "I don't believe in prophecy, not when one can re-write the future", pulls out his gun and points it at John's head.  I liked this scene, because it illustrates John's present and minor role in the Resistance, especially with Command being skeptical of his "predictions".<br /><br />3) Blair Williams/Moon Bloodgood's topless scene; really just a side shot as she washes herself in the rain in a non-sexual manner, and Marcus glances at her briefly.<br /><br />4) Marcus/Blair Williams/redneck fight; the action is a little longer, and a little more brutal.  Marcus stabs one of the attackers with a screwdriver, and we see the impact, as well as the victim painfully removing the screwdriver.  Also, Marcus uses another one of the attackers as a human shield against another's shotgun blast.<br /><br />5) Marcus/Blair Williams campfire scene is slightly longer with additional dialogue between the two.<br /><br />6) Captured humans at Skynet; when one of the prisoners attempts an escape and is shot, we see the bullet impacts.<br /><br />7) John Connor's speech to fellow Resistance members to not obey Ashdown's orders to attack is extended with a few sentences about his mother.  I liked this scene, not sure why they cut it.  It ties T2 in, and shows the impact of Sarah Connor.  (Is this where Christian Bale had his stage lights tantrum?)<br /><br />8) Marcus/T-800 fight scene is slightly longer, shows Marcus getting pummeled a bit more by the T-800.  Also, John tries to revive Marcus an additional time, before collapsing in exhaustion.<br /><br />I would like to add that I enjoyed Terminator 4; much better than the campy T3, and just a shade under T2.  The action was definitely there, and McG included a lot of thoughtful touches from the past movies, e.g. photograph of Sarah Connor, the origin of John's scars, John's like for Guns N'Roses, Sarah Connor's taped voice recordings (actually Linda Hamilton's voice), use of and of course the Arnold cameo.  Who can say no to Michael Ironside?  What I didn't like was Blair Williams' geisha makeup which she wore during air combat.  It made no sense, and was probably one of the deleted portions.  Bryce Dallas Howard was believable as Kate Connor, but her screen time was too short.  Hopefully, a future cut will show more of her relationship with John.<br /><br />Some have said that Christian Bale's performance was wooden, or that John Connor's role was overshadowed by Sam Worthington's role as Marcus Wright.  I disagree with both counts; Bale played Connor as he should have been; grizzled, scarred, gruff.  Given that we know so much already about the future and John's role from prior Terminator movies, it makes sense to have another character portray the center protagonist role.  I also liked the idea of the audience first seeing John as a minor Tech-Com officer, steadily rising through the ranks and gaining influence.<br /><br />Additionally, the movie's opening and closing scenes had a poetic touch to it, which I appreciated.  Marcus begins the film about to be executed, giving his body to a cybernetic program.  The film ends with the same shots of needle plungers being depressed, albeit for a different reason.  Marcus leaves the world as a cyborg, but giving his body to a human cause.<br /><br />I did have one concern about the movies; how come the Arnold T-800 didn't die when John Connor shot the molten steel onto its head?  Turns out there's a perfectly scientific explanation (McG consulted a metallurgist).<br /><br />Here's McG's answer: "There are different characteristics of molten steels, and that was an earlier steel process after it had been separated from the coke. We went over this with a metallurgist, discussing which metals burn at which degrees. And also, if it had stayed on [the T-800], perhaps it would've melted him, but it was frozen quickly enough by the [liquid nitrogen]. Plus, we make the transition from the molten metal to the cooling property so quickly -- as a function of the T-800 being on [John] Connor -- that it wouldn't have had time to melt the existing titanium exoskeleton in time."<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're a diehard Terminator fan, go ahead and pick up this version.  Otherwise, wait for the (hopefully) longer extended cut.
for the movie itself, i give it 5 stars. I loved Terminator Salvation. But overall, the Director's cut was kind of a let down.<br /><br />the regular version is exactly 115 minutes, Director's Cut is 117 minutes. THe only real added shots in the Director's cut is a surprise terminator attack at the beginning of the film (when Connor leads his men down the water filled tunnel), a bit more Connor speach where he mentions his mom right before "then what is the point in winning" and the "nude" shot of Moon Bloodgood.<br /><br />the 2nd disc features 2 Terminator Salvation features. the 1st one is solid, called "Refocusing on the future". This feature runs about 20 minutes and is pretty neat, but way too short. Clerks 2 for exampled had a feature that ran over 1 hour covering everything from pre-production to post production.<br /><br />the 2nd feature has about 4 short (3-5 minutes each) features that talk about the moto-terminators, the return of Arnold, the use of the Air Force in helping with the film, etc.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is awesome, but the DVD Director's cut is a let down when you really think about it. They really could have just stuck everything on one DVD instead of 2.<br /><br />for this reason, 4 stars.
The movie was good, a few bad lines, but mostly the editing was really off, they shouldn't have cut the time down to under 2 hours and made it a PG-13 flick.  That was a big mistake, that's like making Rambo a G-rated film, it's just not right.  Christian Bale is good as John Connor, he gives an alright performance, but he could have done a little better.  Anton Yelchin (Young Kyle Reese) did a superb job portraying the young hardened soldier who will eventually go back to protect young Sarah Connor, but not in this film.  The movie is good, but due to editing and script changes here and there, caused the movie's poor performance at the box office.  It's still a good film to watch, it gives us a fresh new look at the world post Judgment Day.  It's NO James Cameron film by a long shot, but still decent with good action.  Just don't expect to follow the plot as it has it's ups and downs by the different writers that wrote the screenplay.  Expect a future blu-ray/dvd Terminator Salvation: Extended Cut (I don't know what they will call it) to contain most of the deleted scenes 30-40 mins worth with the original ending and an alternate storyline to debut sometime in late 2010.  It's an alternate version of the film, much like Donner's Superman II cut.  This only has 3 mins added, with Moon Bloodgood's breasts and a couple of F-Bombs in this sad director's cut.
The Terminator franchise is an odd beast.  Since the original 1984 feature, it has been sold to three (soon to be four) different production companies and two different studios.  The only times the plot and dialogue have blended well together were in the first two movies, thanks to the care and writing skill of the younger James Cameron.  Since then, the timeline, plot, and characters of Terminator have gone through mutations and minor changes, either to the delight or disappointment of fans (usually the latter).  For a franchise that doesn't have millions of fans like Star Trek or even Battlestar Galactica, Terminator still has legs.  And Terminator Salvation was a great opportunity to tie some loose ends left over from the last movie and TV series, and reboot the franchise in the hopes of producing a John Connor trilogy.<br /><br />This film is either the first film of a  second trilogy, or an intermediate movie while the future of the franchise goes up for bid in a Hollywood auction in 2010.  So how is this movie?<br /><br />First the bad news.  Some of the dialogue, as is the case in too many action films, is poor.  I've always believed movie producers should hire more than script doctors.  They should hire an experienced screenwriter or playwright to give the dialogue a go-over.  The plots are usually okay.  But the words coming out of character's mouths can always use an upgrade.  Again, I look at Aliens as a model in how smart action movie dialog should be written.  At least the dialogue in Terminator Salvation holds together for the first 20 minutes of the 117 minute director's cut.<br /><br />Slightly less bad news - if the director prefers to be known as 'MCG' (Joseph McGinty Nichol), and whose previous works were the two Charlie's Angels films, you know he's going to spin his wheels and show-off a little bit.  And MCG does.  But he also proves for the first time that he is capable of assembling top-grade action sequences that are both thrilling and comprehensible (unlike Christopher Nolan, who seemed incapable of directing a good action sequence in The Dark Knight, IMO).  MCG seems to have done his homework.  His attention to detail setting-up and executing action sequences is similar to the directors he grew-up with (George Lucas, Brian DePalma, John Woo, James Cameron).  If I were the executive producer, I would have wanted Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) to direct, or at least a director who didn't give himself a nickname.<br /><br />And finally, the movie does go off the rails a bit towards the end.  The second half of the movie is poor and cliched.  Christian Bale gets more screen time in the second half, but the final acts test the boundaries of medical and physical plausibility.  Also the second half is weighed-down by b-movie explosions, obvious homages to the first two Terminator movies, and brief tips of the cap to The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Aliens (not so brief with the last movie, as the entire climax seems to replicate Ripley's Rescue).  The first half of the film is clearly better than the second half.  At least the two halves are bridged by a most impressive (and original) chase and battle sequence in which all the great elements of the film come together beautifully.  That sequence is simply crackerjack.<br /><br />But everything else in the movie I see as good news, in varying amounts.  Masio Kassar remained as executive producer (from T2 and T3) and hired as much Terminator talent as he could - namely the editor and an apprentice of Stan Winston's.  The casting is fine.  The photography, despite being handled by a disliked, unorthodox DP, is excellent, and matches the film's bleak theme and outlook.  The sound design is close to brilliant, with the machines sounding radically different from the previous three movies to awesome effect.  Danny Elfman's restrained score stays off the soundtrack during most action sequences, allowing the jet engines and explosions to speak for themselves.  Art direction and costumes are all first-rate.  Special effects are almost all top-notch, with the exception of a few cheap explosions and some of the aircraft shots.<br /><br />Some plot weaknesses and poor dialogue aside, this is a wonderfully bleak movie.  Mankind is almost doomed.  The machines are smarter and sometimes more brutal than the previous films.  The machines are not always consistent in their speed (hey they have to take their time to aim at our heroes), but they are always quick to destroy human vehicles before humans, and that is a very welcome bit of smart military strategy on their part.  And some humans are fairly brutal as well.<br /><br />It's tough for a studio to have a bleak movie as its summer tent pole, but that's what Terminator Salvation was to Warner, which struck box office gold a year earlier with The Dark Knight.  Terminator Salvation failed to crack the # 1 spot in its opening weekend.  But it will be remembered for being the best Terminator feature in 18 years, and that is saying quite a lot.
[....]<br /><br />Now, with that out of the way....<br /><br />This "Rated R" cut of the film is truly the best version of it.  I don't agree with the way that some of the additional scenes were dropped in, but it probably serves the film better to not have eloquent wipes and dissolves.  That way, the viewer is dropped into it and it's an enjoyable ride.  McG and Co. really put forth the effort on this film, and contrary to the scathing reviews by the so-called "professionals", it is rather enjoyable.  It sure as hell beats most of the other films that came out around the Summer period!<br /><br />The action, effects, and storytelling were done very well.  However, there are times when Worthington and Bale's Australian and English accents came out in the dialogue.  I must admit that it distracted me from the experience and reminded me that it was "just a film" until the next chase or explosion came along.<br /><br />The Bonus Features Disc has some great behind the scenes and "how they did it" stuff, but was kind of short and felt like there could have been more.<br /><br />Overall, a good effort and a good starting point for a new series of films.  Terminator films, even with their flaws, take us on a wild ride.  Mission accomplished.  I await the next one!
Don't get fooled by the digital copy claim that is on for this product. It expired in December 2010. Other than that I am happy with it.
I agree with previous posts! I am so tired of them trying to shove Blue Ray down everyone's throats by forcing them to purchase BR instead of DVDs because they are not putting extras, or alternate versions, or even second discs with the DVD versions anymore. I don't own a Blue Ray player and I'm not buying one just so I can watch extras (however the extras are half the reason I buy a movie a lot of times). I'll keep buying regular old DVD's if they have the FULL PACKAGE or I won't buy any at all and wait until they release it with all the extras. It's crap.<br /><br />I'm in the entertainment industry and I want to see the storyboards, the preproduction, the special effects, hear the commentary, etc. Every time a new wave of movies are released there's less and less on the DVD and they're putting it on TWO blue ray discs (which defeats the purpose of blue ray anyway - it's supposed to hold more and they're putting the same mount of content on 2 blue rays as they did on 2 DVDs). They're just trying to get as much money out of people as they can. It's CRAP.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this movie, but am not happy about the DVD vs. Blue Ray release. Might as well stop making DVD's altogether if you want us to buy Blue Ray so badly.
I thought Salvation was decent, and I was definitely considering purchasing it when it arrives on DVD...well, not anymore. The DVD version is only coming with the theatrical cut while the Blu-ray is coming with that AND the director's cut. Why? DVD is far from being a dead format. I know the studios and such are trying to promote Blu-ray and whatnot, but there are plenty of other ways to do this. Until the director's cut is available on DVD, no purchase from me.
I'm a huge fan of the Terminator series and I saw this movie on the midnight premier when it was released in theaters! I loved the movie, it's something I was wanting to see for a long time, a movie about the future war against skynet. Christian Bale did a great John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright was great too! The movie stayed very true to the previous 3 movies and stuck to the time line way better then T3 did.... When I entered the movie theater, I didn't have any great expectations though, because I'm not a fan of Mc G's previous movies and didn't really think he could pull it off, but he did it. There's been a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but trust me, if you are a true Terminator fan, you are going to love this movie! The action scenes are great, the plot is familiar and also has a little something that feels new and fresh. The actors / actresses did a great job in their rolls and the machines were amazing!<br />I personally think this is the best Terminator movie since T2 and I give the movie 5 stars out of 5, but now to the DVD review.....<br /><br />The Special edition DVD is good, but honestly could've been better and I'm still kind of trippin cuz Mc G promised us a 30-40 minute longer version a long with a bunch of special features, but instead we got about a 20 minute "making of" documentary and a few other extras, not much at all... The Blu-Ray I still haven't seen, but I've heard that there's a few more extras that I wish they would've added. I'm glad I didn't go buy the regular DVD, because the regular DVD just has the PG-13 movie and no extras and that is really screwing fans over IMO.<br />Anyway if you're a REAL Terminator fan, I suggest you add this to your collection, don't mind what the dumb critics say about this movie, because honestly this is one of the best action movies I've seen in a very long time and a great addition to the Terminator franchise. IMO Terminator Salvation is the best Terminator movie since T2: Judgment Day!
Nothing new happens in this movie. It has plenty of action, mostly in the form of explosions, but nothing in the movie actually moves the Terminator story line forward. The viewer goes out where he came in.<br /><br />Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer's intelligence with lazy plot devices. For example, there are scenes involving the movement of massive, clanking machines, yet characters aren't even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them. Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline, or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine.<br /><br />The movie is riddled with such devices. They play out, one after another, for about two hours. Nothing else happens. We learn nothing new.<br /><br />My recommendation is to skip this awful addition to the T series.
while in the broad view this movie progresses the plot very little it is a solid action movie and covers the plot terrifically. the action isn't over the top and any explosion scenes are executed perfectly without making it over the top. you should probably watch the first three movies to be able to pick up on the plot immediately but you can get only fine if you don't assuming you've seen the first 3 previously
Excellent movie.  It successfully tied the three previous Terminator movies together with Salvation, all the way from Arnold to Skynet.  Great special effects, too. This is a MUST OWN MOVIE if you own and/or enjoy ANY of the three previous Terminator's.  The Arnold Terminator was a fantastic surprise when I saw the movie for the first time in the theater. The Arnold-factor alone truly solidifies a bond between all four movies.
I have to give this five stars because I think most of the bad reviews are from one of a few types of people:<br />1) people who havn't followed the terminator movies<br />2) people who just don't like sci-fi<br />3) people who got caught up in the Christian Bale controversy and just want to hate him<br />4) people who don't like the director and can't get past that<br />5) people who think that a movie about cyborgs destroying mankind should have a "funny, light-hearted" feel to it<br />6) people who want it to be like the old movies. You know, get chased for two hours by another new version of the Terminator sent back in time to stop john conner. Then you get to ponder how the future will be changed.<br /><br />First of all Terminator 3 sucked, it was basically a bad remake of T2 even though I still see it as relevant to the series. As for Terminator Salvation, it is about time that the story got around to the future resistance, and it was done beautifully. The story was awesome and left room for other movies. The cinematography was perfect for the mood of the movie, which was appropriately serious and dark. Not overly done when you think about the context of the movie. The special effects were very good, especially when looking back at the old movies you can tell the CG technology has improved. The acting was top-notch, even though Christian Bale didn't seem like the main character he fit the role. Best of all was the detail put into every scene of the movie, you can tell that a lot of effort was put into every aspect.<br /><br />The only thing is that I wish some characters from the Sarah Conner Chronicles were used, and that the movie would have tied in with the TV show somehow since it ended so abruptly. And I thought they could have used claire danes for john conner's wife in this movie, it would have worked.<br /><br />I hoped this could expand into a trilogy of the resistance story using the same main actors and director. But it probably won't because of all the bad reviews from people who probably aren't even fans of Terminator.
I will be the 1st to say when I saw this in theaters I left with alot of questions. But with the maximum movie mode where McG pops up every now and then and explains things and tells you the thought process for alot of scenes I finally understand how this one fits the other 3. Still I think only the true die hard fans of  the Terminator movies will appreciate  this movie.
the blu ray is off the hook and is one of the better ones i've seen. the movie itself is not bad at all. i think people were expecting mcg to pull a james cameron but of course that wont happen because hes not james cameron lol. he still gives you an interesting story with good special affects. this is a lot better than what i was expecting so i give it a solid four.
This movie is pretty unique in the fact that it has 2 male lead characters. (Christian Bale as John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright) and suprisingly, it works. Thy manage to pull it off without eclipsing each other. Performances were good specially Worthington's even thou Bale did a terrific job as well and Anton Yelchin's performance as Kyle Reese was really believable (This guy also played the Russian genius kid in the new Star Trek). Effects were good, story was enjoyable and interesting. They even throw a couple of nods to the previous terminators that were really cool. All in all, not as era-defining as Terminator 2 but a worthy addition to the series nevertheless. (Unlike Rise of the Machines, which I think we can all agree, it's OK to pretend it never happened).
This movie is so massively wrong-headed, and so overtly throws sod on the original Terminator film, that I can only assume it's deliberate.  I can only conclude that director McG and the small army of writers who held this film in development hell for several years purposely want to sour you and me on James Cameron's 1984 classic.  What other explanation can there be for such transparent awfulness?<br /><br />Deep in the violence of post-nuclear 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) struggles as a low-ranking officer in the Resistance.  Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), executed by the state fifteen years earlier, awakes not one day older, already in the thick of fighting.  But in a matter of hours, Wright finds the one thing both the Machines and Connor need: the current location of young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).<br /><br />The original Terminator flourished by taking common fears and making them happen on screen before us.  Because many of us distrust ordinary technology, Cameron's 1984 film is justly considered a classic.  This film, by contrast, seems written as a showcase for the special effects.  There is not one moment of tension, not one revealing human moment, not one point at which I feel this movie is telling the truth.<br /><br />This film suffers innumerable orchestrated set pieces, fight sequences, and explosions.  Everything is tightly so choreographed, I never get the feeling anything has really happened.  If you doubt what I mean, I commend to your imagination the image of a CGI Arnold, head surrounded by a halo of anti-aliasing artifacts, tossing Christian Bale like a Frisbee.  Yeah, the whole movie is like that.<br /><br />Then we have all the bits and bobs stolen from other, better sci-fi movies.  You could make a drinking game out of spotting them all.  Beer for Star Wars, wine for The Matrix, liquor for Spielberg's War of the Worlds.  Make 'em double shots for images taken from sequels.  I saw not one original set piece, line of dialog, or piece of physical design in this entire 118-minute disaster.<br /><br />Cameron's original Terminator was one of the greatest works of film ever.  The second film was good.  The third was adequate.  This one is awful.  I don't throw negative superlatives around, because they get abused, but this is the worst film I've seen in at least three years.  I will watch no more Terminator films.  I love the original too much to see the franchise desecrated this way.
I was a big fan of the franchise but this really is not part of it. Unlike all the other films, it lacks a story, or even characters you care about. Hard to imagine since it is based on franchise with characters you DO care about. But the truly talentless MTV director McG (and whoever wrote this confusing dark mess of a script) shows his only skill is stringing together a bunch of explosions and fight scenes.<br /> One of the first problems is the John Conner character and the terminator prototype character look so much alike, it's hard to tell who is who through much of the movie, especially since it is mostly shot in dark, grimy locales. Second big problem -- a complete lack of humor or heart. Totally cardboard characters that its hard to care anything about. Third problem -- the ending sequence is ludicrous. So many holes there it's hard to know where to begin.<br /> So here's the deal. You like lots of explosions and fights -- go for it. Lots of that here. You want a movie that makes sense or has any sort of connection to the original Terminator movies, forget it.
Can someone tell me what this movie was about?<br />The plot (if there WAS one) was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again (and have done) in spite of Edward Furlong's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor.<br />There's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED.<br />One HUGE disappointment. Sorry - I WON'T "be back" if this is the best they can do!!
I have purchased several Blu-Ray movies through Amazon and I have always been very satisfied with the Delivery time and Quality of the Blu-Ray DVD's until I purchased this one, I ordered this Blu-Ray DVD at the same time I ordered 3 other Blu-Ray DVD's and this one took an extra 10 day's to arrive after I received the other 3 Blu-Ray DVD's.
I liked the movie it goes along with the story and they even brought back the original terminator "Arnold Schwarzenegger." A lot of action and destruction so if your a guy like me which loves vilence then this a good movie to see if you haven't seen it.
Not near as good as I was hoping. Thought it would take place right after Sky-Net took over not some years down the line. I hope one day I'm good enough to twist a few wires on a car that has set for years and am able to start it within a minte or two. ;)
OK, this a must own, I enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy the whole series. Finally we are in the future. The fight is never over.
Saludos! Para las personas que quedaron decepcionadas con la ultima entrega (me incluyo) de las pel&iacute;culas de terminator llega esta nueva que revive esta gran saga: SALVATION con un excelente argumento y un buen elenco, aparte de traer idiomas en ingles y espa&ntilde;ol.<br /><br />Andr&eacute;s
The director's cut is better than the original but did not have as much added back as I would have liked and I personally think the special features would have fitted on the movie disk. This movie could have been better if it had more scenes added back in or at the least more special features.
I actually liked this movie... Of course im used to seeing Arnold in these series. But, the story line of this movie kept me interested enough to keep watching. It's definitly worth watching!
If you have liked even one of the Terminators, then you will like this one.  My favorite of them all.

I am a huge fan of the Terminator series. The second movie being my personal favorite and also just my favorite movie of all time. 'Nuff said. That being said, it's hard for me to watch a Terminator and be... impartial I guess you could say cuz I love this series so damn much. That first Terminator movie was incredible and you were really hoping to see more of the incredible story unfold. After Judgment Day, I would always wonder what the hell happened to the movies?! At the very least, there were plenty of Terminator comics you could follow. I never actually read them cuz I was just a kid and had no idea of there existence until more recently... I've gotten side tracked... Uhhh I read Robocop vs Terminator though. That was awesome. OK back on track: Flash forward some 12 years I see a commercial for another Terminator movie. Well its about damn time. I saw it, thought it was dope few things coulda been done differently but I didn't care. The franchise had finally been revived. So all that side tracking and talking about movies and comics that have nothing to do with the rating of this movie brings me to... this movie. Terminator Salvation. As I was walking out of the theater, I thought it was an incredible movie and they did absolutely no wrong with it. We're finally seeing what we've been waiting to see since Kyle Reese talked about the future way back in the first movie. Now I gotta step back and attempt to impartiality. This is gonna be tough... OK visually; stunning. Bale as John Connor; I've heard it before and I agree. His stoic acting needed to go somewhere. Nothing against him as an actor cuz I enjoy the stuff he's done but I don't feel like he portrayed John Connor the way he should have. Also, its gotta be rough hiding that accent and trying to act a certain way so I'll just chalk it up to that. Ok, the story; Yeah, it was pretty weak.(Spoilers) Exactly what I mean by that is that the machines knowing of Kyle Reese's existence and even capturing him and not offing him that very second didn't make any sense. That would have been the end of everything right there. I have no beef with Marcus' character either. Considering all the changes that happened in the past, it makes sense for something new to emerge in this altered future. It's also cool cuz you have this guy who lost his humanity to Skynet and wants to take names because of it. I think that about covers it. Giving this movie 3 stars makes me feel dirty though. If it were possible to give it 3 and a half I would
Christian Bale and Sam Worthington star in this 2009 sci-fi film.<br />In 2018, John Connor rescues his father with a cyborg's help.<br />This is pretty good and Christian is great as John. This dvd<br />has nice picture and sound, but no extras. I still recommend<br />this.
I purchased this product thinking it would be some excellent version and not disappoint. Was great in terms of quality and sound, but the major gripe I had with this was that though it was shot in 16:9, the actual picture size was far less and compensated for the balance using black bars. To make it worse, the black bars were of a different contrast to the standard filler area that is seen on 16:10 displays. Well, it was a good watch with 3 discs and I like the movie, so I'll give it 3 stars instead of 2. Bittersweet purchase.
After seeing this film in theaters I immediately drew a comparison to Blade Runner.  That film was released at a time where critics complained about the lack of a strong narrative and not enough substance.  I think this film befell a similar fate and was widely dismissed upon release.  Well I loved every minute of this film from the opening frame and waited over 6 months for the Blu-ray release.  This movie is not only highly entertaining but also touches upon the ideas that make us human.  I think after the Cristian Bale rant was somehow released a lot of the critics and audiences failed to appreciate his performance and considered this movie to be a mindless action film.  It's funny that the Transformers movie came out a little after this movie and was really panned (rightly so) for being a mindless exercise.  This film at least builds upon the previous mythology and creates several new interesting characters such as the Sam Worthington character who is only looking for a second chance.  At the end of the day I think in years to come this film will be given a second chance and will be appreciated for it's strong narrative, brilliant casting, wonderful cinematography, creative action scenes and strong direction.  Ever since the first Terminator film I have waited for another dark mythology driven fantasy of a future that is always a possibility.  We must never forget what makes us human.
i love this movie in the teather, but in blue ray is more detailed and with an excelent sound you will centanly enjoy
This was a gift for my son-in-law for<br />Christmas and I got it for a super<br />price because I pre-ordered it on<br />Amazon as a gift. Thank you Amazon
Hello !,<br />I received this B-RD in time and not damage, cheers!.<br />Best regards
I just seen this movie about 4 days ago. Its a really good movie, and honestly the best out of the Terminator series. Definitly a movie worth buying. SO GET IT LOL.
I've watched this movie 3 times now and I must say I do enjoy the action part of the movie, that being said some of the script could have been much better, some of the lines delivered are just ridiculous. for example the character Marcus delivers a line " So that's what death taste's like" after kissing the Doctor in the beginning of the movie was very corny. Also there are some major issues when Marcus meets Kyle Reese, didnt Kyle find it odd that Marcus wasnt aware of why he didnt know about "Judgement Day" he never questions that? The movie was drivin more for action than character development..so if you keep that in mind you can still enjoy the movie.<br /><br />The DVD quality is as follows:<br />Picture is very good even in most of the darker scenes, and the digital grading used to make most of the movie look greyish is well done.<br />The sound dept  for the Dolby Digital 5.1 Mix is excellent, great use of surrounds and Subwoofer which should be expected with an Action movie.<br /><br />In closing I hope the next Terminator movie has some better lines and character development, I enjoyed the Marcus character, but felt it could have been better.<br /><br />So leave your brain on off and just watch the movie and enjoy
I'm a Terminator fan and like all the movies and I wasn't disappointed with this one for sure.  It was also at a very reasonable price through Amazon especially since it had just come out on DVD.  I'm happy with my experience.
Terminator Salvation was predictable and mostly unrealistic.  However, there was a gritty emotional component to the movie and storyline that just worked enabling you to connect to the characters.  As a result, it was a darn good movie.
great continuation of the Terminator saga.. Salvation should of came right after T2-JD, but at least we have it now! love it, love it!!
I liked this film the least of the films and less than The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I think the action scenes were good and McG did surprisingly well with them and the acting. I think the biggest flaw was having the focus away from John Connor. I don't think the Marcus character was compelling at all. It could have been eliminated at the script stage and the heart transplant in a tent is just ridiculous... With the bidding war on between Lionsgate and Sony over the Terminator rights, this may be the last big budget Terminator film we'll see. It's a shame, I think there is more story to tell...
this is a vevy good movie i have wacth it 3 times now. i love it,it keeps you on you feet.
Good effecs, pour argument, but the movie is not to bat, in list you pass the time, the actor is good very good a refer to Bale (Batman).
I am a fan of the Terminator saga. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was the best movie of the series. This film is certainly better then part 3. The DVD displays everything you saw in the movie theater. Unfortunately, there are no extra features on this disk. I was disappointed when I couldn't watch any deleted scenes. This product is good for one who just wants to watch the basic movie, but the dvd will not satisfy serious fans.
This movie was awesome. Great action, characters, and a great story. It never had a dull moment.
I gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas.  This was what he had asked for.  He's watched it and enjoys it.  Shipping was immediate and the DVD was in perfect working order.  This is the place to buy.  Never a problem.
the product arrived way before the deadline in perfect condition, I would say NEW or like new.
Loved this movie. I was expecting the worst but this terminator movie is runner up to the original only.
A terminator that is not advertise the star of the show ,but really brings the story in a better level than the other terminators . To all of these people Bravo !!! GOOD JOB.
I thought the movie was decent, but I was very impressed on how fast it arrived after I placed my order.
I guess I really dont get why so many ppl trash this movie, sure it's not perfect (how many are?), but it is a great action movie in my opinion and I was entertained by it. I like many of you am also a fan of the terminator series and yes I know T2 rocked and was the best. Is it b/c Arnold is no longer there, except in the cgi form (which I thought looked really fake and they couldve left out) or perhaps b/c James Cameron didn't direct it? Personally I judge it on its own accord (new actors/new director) rather than comparing it to previous Terminator movies.<br /><br />I liked Mr. Bale as Connor, he did a pretty good job. I liked the story line w/ Marcus revolting and helping to save Connor and the resistance and Connor risking everything to save his teenage future dad from skynet. The action scenes were really intense and the movie does have a modern/futuristic feel to it which is cool. Although I wish the movie was longer, 1 hr 45 minutes(approx.) just seems too short in my opinion, it would've been better say at 2hrs 15 minutes or so and thus allowed for a bit more depth & character development. I dont like the clean PG-13 rating. I would like it to be more violent, bloody, gory, gritty, etc. staying true to a real war situation. Overall, I'm glad they made this movie, it gives the series new legs, and I look forward to more.
Lots of action, but terminator2 still the best. T1is a classic action film. Ok but not as great as previous terminators.
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OKAY HOWEVER, PREVIOUS MOVIES WERE AT ANOTHER LEVEL. MOVIE SEEMED DARKER THAN NEEDED BUT ACTING OFFSET SOME OF IT, WOULD RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO OTHERS.
Christan Bale gives a outstanding genuine heart felt performance as John Connor. I also enjoyed the fact that they had a half human half terminator in this film. The coolest thing besides that is a CGI cameo by Arnold Swartzeneger in the final act of the movie. The special effects were sweet as well as the stunts and robotics. Anton Yelchin was really good as teenage Kyle Reese. This was a genuine portrayal of the future war against machines. The picture is okay for what picture the format can produce. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that this dvd version does not include the "Director's Cut" version of the movie. I would also like to point out that the dvd has absolutely no extras. The Blu-ray version of the movie not only includes the "Director's cut" but other extras that talk about how they did stunts and effects for the movie. The "Director's Cut" version of the movie is 3 minutes longer and includes a nude scene in the rain of Moon Bloodgood, more blood in the scene where men attempt to rape her, and a tension building scene between Christian Bale and Michael Ironside in which "General Ashdown" puts a gun to John Connor's head. I prefered the "Director's Cut" version of the movie because it lent more to the story emotionally and visually. Also to those who think there is no difference between "Blu-ray" and "Dvd" you need to get some glasses morons. It offers 6x the resolution that "Dvd" produces, and you get a much more crisper detailed picture. The difference is mind blowing considering it is a increase in resolution of "720x480i" to "1920x1080p." You would have to be an idiot to not consider buying a "Blu-ray" player if you own a "HDTV". DVD is fine if you have a tube tv but it is so blury and nasty on a "HDTV." The Bottom line is Terminator Salvation is better on Bluray. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55HQ">Terminator Salvation (Widescreen Edition)</a>
This is a terrific movie for a loyal follower of the Terminator Series. Christian Bale does a fantastic job in his role as John Conner. Intense, gripping and hold onto your seat action. Excellent sequel. I do hope he does a second movie as the same character.<br /><br />One of best things was the delivery of this movie to my home. Ordered it on Friday morning and was watching it the next day! Cudos Amazon!!!
I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he has already watched it 4 times. Looks great on his new bluray player. He said it's even better than watching it in the theater.
When I think of the "Terminator" film franchise, two things immediately come to mind: an iconic leading actor (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) who can carry the film, and an interesting time-travel plot that will keep you engaged while things are blowing up.  This film, by casting Christian Bale and continuing the basic timeline, ensures a successful fourth installment.<br /><br />Basically, in "Terminator Salvation", we finally get a glimpse into the future, where a group of human resistance fighters led by John Connor (Bale) are battling to stay alive as the machines hunt them down one colony at a time.  While the war rages on, Connor listens to the tapes handed to him from his mother at the conclusion of T2 and realizes that he must find and protect young Kyle Reese in order to maintain his (and mankind's) entire existence.  Complicating matters is the fact that the robotic Skynet has created their ultimate weapon...a "terminator" who thinks he is a human, throwing Connor and his gang for a loop.<br /><br />Though not a classic film in any sense of the word, I felt that this addition was welcome to the franchise for its ability to show what the earlier films only hinted at...the human resistance against Skynet.  The casting of Bale lends automatic credence to the entire project, and he lives up to the billing with the best-acted performance of the show, and the human-cyborg plot angle does two things: preview the "terminators" of the future, and set up an interesting ethical dilemma for Connor.<br /><br />Plus, I also loved the subtle nods to the three previous installments in the franchise, such as a cameo from Arnold and Bale's own twist on the iconic "I'll be back" line.<br /><br />Thus, although I feel that this film could have been much more epic, it was, as a fan of the Terminator franchise, entertaining enough to hold my interest until the very end.  It also sets the stage for a possible sequel, which would be the true test of whether this re-boot will be the next "Batman Begins", or instead turn into "Superman Returns".
great graphics, good sci fi, our family of 5, 4 of which are male love the terminator movies.
This movie is nowhere near bad as people say it is. It isn't even near bad period!<br /><br />Now some may have had different expectations going into it of what it would be, but that's their own fault. The movie is awesome.
I barely remember the Terminator movies, so the impact was less harmfull on<br />watching terminator salvation. I was'nt really looking for a continuation of the<br />franchise, i just wanted to be entertained.  And that's what this movie does.<br />I found the movie had great effects, good sound and some great robots. The<br />characters in the film were interesting and the acting was decent.  I find it<br />soo weird to see a digitized Arnold near the end...but a must for the movie.<br />A keeper...good to watch multiple times.
Terminator Salvation is a good action movie, continues the Terminator saga.  Don't go in expecting it to make a lot of sense though.  Just sit back, watch and enjoy.  And as usual in this series, the Terminator is by far the best character and the one you root for.
great pic that fills the gap, and like the other films has the terminator as the savior
I was hoping for more from this but it was busy paying homage to the prior Terminator catch phrases and not focused enough on plowing its own ground.  On Blu it was amazing to watch at home.  There is a scene at the gas station where a ginormous Terminator thing flattens everything in its path.  At the theater that scene was one of the best of all of the summer blockbusters.  At home it's not as impressive but the sound and picture quality on this disc is stunning.  I watched on a Panasonic plasma, 50", 1080p via HDMI from a Playstation3.
I really wanted to like TERMINATOR SALVATION.  In fact, after the first few scenes, I thought I would.<br />But fate was not going to be kind to me on that count.<br /><br />First, what went right (there will be spoilers):<br /><br />[a] Future War - you get to see what it is like for the survivors of J-Day to actually fight the machines.<br />[b] Opening sequence - from Marcus getting the needle to the attack on the R&D facility, the image quality, action, characters and plot actually started to work for me.<br />[c] Warthogs - any movie that includes the A-10 is worth watching.<br />[d] Skynet Central - it looked both technologically advanced, as well as kind of primitive.<br />[e] Human Prisoners - the reaction of John Connor to the prisoner issue was believable and worked as a motive for insubordination.<br /><br />Now, for what went wrong:<br />[f] The War Against the Machines - viewers did not get to see many details about this all-encompassing conflict.  Did you see any soldiers' banter during down time?  Burials? Chaplains? Did you see any of their supply chain? I mean humanity was nearly wiped out.  Where do they get their food, fuel, ammunition, spare parts and communication gear?  I mean, the amount of screen time needed to clarify this is minimal; a couple of conversations between characters about such things could make all the difference between plausible and hard-to-swallow.<br />[g] Arnold - did we really need to see CGI Arnold?  I mean, the story has to stand on its own, and inserting him was a waste of time and effort.  He could have been in a background shot of the management of Skynet before J-Day and that would have worked; but he did not need to be in the movie.<br />[h] Marcus - he should have been driven to the brink of insanity by all that happened.  He was on DEATH ROW one minute, and then in the middle of what looks like a cross between Antietam and the Tet Offensive.  I'd be nearly bonkers.  Wouldn't you?<br />[i] Marcus' plug-in - When Marcus connected to Skynet and learned all about J-Day, why didn't he react more visibly than he did?  Why did Skynet take the personae of Connor, Reese and Dr. Serena Kogan, when it could have taunted him w/ the memories of his dead brother?<br />[j] Skynet is Omniscient, 1 - how in the world could Skynet have known that Kyle Reese should be targeted for elimination?  It seemed like a distraction to me, making ONE KID the focus of their efforts.<br />[k] Skynet is Omniscient, 2 - why did Skynet develop an obsession with John Connor so early?  It would be like making the focus of World War One not to defeat Germany but to take out Corporal Adolf Hitler.  Had the writers any common sense, Skynet would have targeted Connor FOR HIS EXPLOITS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.  A bit of dialog could have covered that easily.<br /><br />Try this on for size:<br /><br />General Ashdown: "You really got their attention hitting their factory two years ago, and the ammo dump last month; now all I see on the intel reports is that they want your head on a stick"<br />John Connor: "It's what I was born to do"<br /><br />[l] The Signal - too easy, and Connor should have known this; if Ashdown had said that his boys put together a VIRUS that MIGHT shut them down, and it needed to be tested, that would have been a bit more believable.<br />[m] John takes a dive into treacherous waters - Although it worked for me that the Commanders were on a sub, did Connor really have to take a dive into the Perfect Storm?  Did anyone on the production team ever hear of hypothermia?<br />[n] White Hat Wipeout - In many movies and TV shows, it seems to be a popular notion to kill all of the hero's forces, to reinforce the hopelessness of the situation.  In TS all of the Resistance fighters get waxed (except for Character Shield Connor) NEEDLESSLY.  Had the writers put in a big gun battle that would have been much more enjoyable, and advance the notion that the war is WINNABLE.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Connor's team gets pinned down by two groups of T-600's, calls in an air strike, and a medevac.  In the middle of it all, the hackers get their data, and fight their way back to beaten-up Huey with Common as a door gunner mowing down any metal that came their way.<br /><br />After dropping off the wounded @ the infirmary, the hackers then PRESENT their findings to command, with Connor ready to add his two cents about the new machines.<br /><br />See how simple it is to describe an action sequence and the aftermath?<br /><br />[o] Marcus meets Connor - who in the world wrote that dialog?  Why even mention Kyle Reese? I found it to be too Deus-Ex-Machina for my taste.  They did not follow the 'show don't tell' rule of film making.<br />[p] Climactic battle - only ONE T-800 was available for action?  I mean this is SKYNET; they have countless machines available for use.  Oh, and I didn't know that John Connor's heart and lungs had WOLVERINE'S mutant healing power.  I mean a few gun shots could have more believably imperiled his life, and it would have made Marcus's sacrifice needless.<br />[q] Heart Transplant - the notion that a heart transplant can be performed IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT is a bit of a stretch for my small, reptilian mind.  But not the geniuses behind their Clark Novas.<br /><br />All in all it was good, but not up to 'Terminator' or 'T2' standards, but better than 'T3.'  And, don't get me started on Fox's cancellation of the TV show 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.'  Arguably one the best Movie-to-TV adaptations EVER but it had ZERO continuity w/ TS.<br /><br />Now if only James Cameron, or Joss Whedon were to actually obtain the rights, and do something worthwhile with the franchise.  There's still life in it, but it needs to be nurtured.<br /><br />I have ranted enough - please rate my review even if you think I'm a complete idiot.<br /><br />moneybagzz out.
good movie John Connor (Christian Bale) a little over the top (over dramatic at times), good CGI - loved the bikes.
I never bothered to see this in the theater because I couldn't really accept a PG-13 rated Terminator.  I understand that that is the money rating, but come on.  I'm actually glad I bought this the R-rated version because I really enjoyed it.  The action was good and really well shot.  Overall it was really a good flick.  It wasn't the epic that I was hoping for, but it is definately a solid 4 star action flick.<br /><br />***MILD SPOILER***<br />I hadn't heard anything specific about this movie so when the T-800 came out looking exactly like an early-mid 80's Arnold I was pleasantly shocked because during the marketing of this they made such a point to say that he wasn't going to be in it when I saw him I got goose bumps.  I realize it was a CG head (or at least face) but that was pretty sweet.<br />*****NO MORE SPOILERS*****<br /><br />All in all I recommend it for any fans of the first two Terminators.  It's at least worth a rental.  I do hope the extended version that everyone seems to be talking about gets released.  I'd like to see that.
While this is no T2 (the best in the franchise, in my opinion), Salvation is at least better than T3 which was a ham-fest.  This provides a different view on the Terminator series in the sense that it does take place in 2018.  I went in to this movie with little or no expectations because of the bad reviews and came out pleasantly surprised.  It's a decent film.  I would (and have) watch it more than once.  What this says for my intelligence is questionable (as it seems to be made with someone with a low IQ) but sometimes these mindless-fun popcorn movies end up being the best guilty pleasures.
It's saving grace is that it did have a plot and it did sync up pretty well with the other 3 Terminator movies, but it could have been so much better, especially with an actor like Christian Bale staring in it.  I've really enjoyed all of his movies and tried so hard to like this one as well.  It was filled with CGI, most of it fair to bad as well as goofy things that no human could ever survival, like a helocast from a pretty decent altitude at a high rate of speed that John Conner performed and didn't even get wet in the process.  The plot was overcast by almost non-stop action in an apparent attempt to hide it, which is a real shame, as the plot is a noble one.  The ending was unsurprising as well.  Of course we all know that John Conner has to survive or the other movies in the franchise wouldn't make sense, but there was only one surprise to the whole thing and that card should have been played closer to the end so that boredom wouldn't set in before it thankfully came to an end.
While lacking the blend of action and humanity that made the first two movies so good, this is a decent film as long as you don't go in with ginormous expectations.<br /><br />The plot is a little jumbled, the movie takes some time to hit its stride and the acting (especially by the leads) is plastic at times, but there are some good action sequences and enough going on that I was able to power through some wicked tiredness to watch this at 1 a.m. the other day.<br /><br />I particularly liked Marcus Wright's plotline, which is unfortunately undermined by some subpar acting on Worthington's part. I kind of enjoyed the fact that John Connnor isn't head of the human resistance; after the last two films one expects him to be the honcho. It was cool how John used his computer know-how in a few situation, harking back to T2 when he hacks into the ATM. The Kyle Reece storyline and the actor who plays him are really cool. That could almost have been its own movie.<br /><br />There was a lot I didn't like, or at least a lot of things I wish the filmmakers had re-considered:<br /><br />-- The numerous obvious nods to other moves are rife: Marcus emerges screaming and muddy from a subterranean labyrinth (Shawshank Redemption). John Connor's radio broadcast's to the at-large resistance fighters (Apocalypse Now). The final scene when John is rigging the nuclear power cells is both a cop of the end of Aliens and the first Terminator movie. A machine collects humans and holds them for transport (a theme from War of the Worlds that also looks very much like Spielberg's from a few years ago).<br /><br />-- Marcus emerges into a world he doesn't know, and yet he seems completely at ease. No freak-out over the destruction of humanity? No concern over robots hunting humans with giant machine guns?<br /><br />-- There are A-10 Warthog planes pulling maneuvers no A-10 Warthog could ever accomplish.<br /><br />-- The machines and the humans are in an all-out war. The machines are actively hunting the humans and yet on several occasions the resistance is seen staging raids out of giant army bases and airplane hangers full of equipment. Wouldn't that be a bit of a tell for the machines?<br /><br />-- It seems awfully easy for John to infiltrate the Skynet headquarters and do as he pleases. What, no perimeter guards as there would be at any central command base?<br /><br />There are a few other qualms I can't think of right now, including more nods to more movies and things the characters do that I personally would not be doing if I was being hunted by bloodthirsty robots. But overall, it's a pretty enjoyable movie that I would probably watch again.
Very solid movie, not as good as I thought it would be, but still worth the money. Great visuals, although the sound was average.
Ever since seeing the flashbacks/flash forwards of the future in the first two Terminator movies, I was really hoping to get a movie about the actual resistance war against the machines.  It has been done in comic book form, but I really wanted the big movie story.  I was actually a bit disappointed by this movie.  I think Bale is a fine choice as leader of the resistance, though he didn't really do as much with the role as I would have liked.  I also thought that the world that had endured a nuclear war and the rising of machines should have looked much more desolate and grim.  The first two movies show a world that is shattered and dark.  The story is okay, though much of it feels like a set up for a sequel that may or may not come based on the low box office take.  Good action sequences make this interesting throughout despite many short comings.
I've been a fan of the Terminator series for as long as there's been a Terminator series and at the conclusion of each of the films there's been a steady theme to my wonderment: When is John Connor going to fulfill his destiny as the savior of humanity?  Unfortunately, my near-famous question remains unanswered once more in Terminator Salvation but before we get into all that, let's explore the nitty-gritty, shall we?<br /><br />The film represents the fourth full-length motion picture release in the Terminator franchise and the first of which is notably missing T-800 Model 101 portrayal by iconic actor-turned politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger (although there is a segment so well done in his absence that I'm actually going to have to look up how they did it).<br /><br />For years now we've seen glimpses into the future via brief sequences in each of the films, video games, television series and so on.  It's almost always the same: Black skies behind a global junkyard just littered with human skulls for the advancing robotic exoskeletons to crush with their feet and tank treads.  Humans cower behind rubble while taking potshots at the seemingly invincible mechanized armada before them, armed with brightly flashing lasers and odd hovering aircraft.  It's pretty bleak but then again it's pretty tough to imagine a friendly scenario when describing an event labeled "Judgment Day".  Here's the thing- for as long as we've been fed these disturbing post apocalyptic images, we've been given the promise of hope in one man; a man so influential in turning the tide against the machines that they have attempted his assassination (unsuccessfully) across three full movies and two seasons of network television.<br /><br />Set in the post Judgment Day timeline, Terminator Salvation has been perhaps the closest in potentially allowing the lead character to begin displaying the sheer omnipotence that will eventually be the machines' undoing (save for a few brief seconds at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines) but alas, the film makes it clear pretty early on that this is more a Kyle Reese survival tale and an excuse to introduce a new mechanized hybrid (Marcus Wright) then it is John Connor's coming into his own.<br /><br />The setting is bleak, but not near as bad as the scene we've been teased with all these years (I'm assuming that's because those shots must have represented the moments directly after the robot-induced nuclear war).  It's 2018 in Salvation and the world has been pretty much handed over to the machines.  Small human outposts are scattered about but the "Resistance" isn't nearly as well defined here as has been hinted to throughout the franchise.  Rather, both a military and civilian presence coexist amidst the mechanical mayhem.<br /><br />Connor is as a member of the military effort here (along with his wife Catherine "Kate") though his portrayal this time around is closer to that of a low-ranking stereotypical loose cannon than a natural born leader.  In the film's defense, by the end an opportunity for Connor's rapid advancement through the ranks is presented, though there is little along the way that hints to exactly how John Connor's going to inevitably turn the tides once and for all (you'll think it is explained early on, but that thread is a bit of a dead end by the film's conclusion as well).<br /><br />One of the coolest elements of the film's timeline is that it allows for a nice intimate look at some of the weapons and mechanized beasties that the machines have built in effort to keep us lowly humans in check.  Love or hate the influence computer-generated imaging has had on movie making in recent years, there is little doubt that the sheer scale and complexity of many of the sequences here would not have been possible when the earlier films were dazzling movie-goers.<br /><br />Among the mentionables are a single-shot helicopter crash sequence that certainly harkens back to some of the finer techniques used in Cloverfield and a robotic sentry that's absolutely terrifying due to it's sheer size and firepower.  I will refrain from gushing over the motorcycle-piloting droids ("Mototerminators") that dislodge from the large Harvesters to give chase, the slow, methodic machine-gunning of the T-600s, or the very Matrix-esque "Hydrobots" that patrol the waterways.  The point is there is far more going on in the land of the machines than simply mindless marching metal skeletons.<br /><br />And speaking of the Matrix, it would be wrong to skate through this review without at least mentioning the apparent influence the series had on the Terminator's prose.  In all fairness Terminator did it first but while the T-movies were typically set in contemporary time frames with classic horror elements driving a very human emotional chase, this is the first opportunity for the franchise to shift into true science fiction mode.  And I'm pleased to report that it does that well.  Everything from hand-to-hand combat, futuristic weapons, human-mechanical hybrids, to radioactive fallout make their presence felt here.  Couple this to the typical tension-laden "Terminator" sound score and you have yourself a heck of fun thrill ride.<br /><br />Surprisingly, however (especially considering the swing to science fiction), there is really absolutely nothing to do with time travel in this one.  It is mentioned in the dialog and the back story of John Connor attempting to keep young Kyle Reese (his father) safe so that he himself may exist, pays homage to the time-twisting prose of the prior films, but nowhere here is the concept solidified.  So much so is it's avoidance that it leaves viewers wondering such things is how the technology will be discovered, by whom, and so on.<br /><br />Maybe it's for the best such things were left untouched considering the sheer amount of continuity discrepancies already taking up server space just in arguments stemming from the time travel in the first three movies and the Sarah Connor Chronicle TV series.<br /><br />Other minor complaints include an impromptu heart transplant (in the most non-sterile environment imaginable) and a John Connor with an absolute disdain for mechanical organisms (despite, as the other movies/ TV shows have led us believe, having practically grown up around those that protected him as well as tried to destroy him).  Small nit picks, sure, but long time fans of the franchise will surely pick up on these things.<br /><br />In all, and despite what my review may have you thinking, this is an enjoyable film from beginning to end.  If this seems hard to believe considering my abundant criticisms, rest assured that the Terminator pictures have rarely stood up well to scientific scrutiny.  The point is they exist to entertain and Salvation, just like the others, doesn't disappoint in that area.  The action is intense, the pace nice and brisk, and the visuals quite spectacular throughout.  The acting is solid and even the science doesn't require absolute suspension of disbelief (usually a prerequisite in scifi).  At the end of the day it's a fun popcorn flick that manages to make up for its lack of intricate story structure with sheer style.  Just don't go in expecting to finally understand why the robots of the future have made it their number one priority to eliminate John Connor even if they had to invent time travel to do it... It's one of many Terminator discrepancies best left to debate on the fan forums.
Taking the advice from some people here, I found the 2-disc with a few extras at Target. Apparently Target has the exclusive deal on this. The movie is the "Director's Cut" with slight variations to the theatrical version. There is no commentary track here. The Special Features are found  on the second disc along with the digital copy. Personally, the digital copy doesn't do a thing for me. First up is "Reforging The Furture" which runs 18:59 and shows how the filmmakers reinvented the franchise. Then there are 4 featurettes - "Digital Destruction", "Enlisting The AirForce", "An Icon Returns", "Stan Winston Shop". These four total 11:30. So is it worth it to spend the extra cash for just a hand full of extras? I guess, but I would have loved to have more extras including a commentary.
I just got my copy of the Blu Ray version and it is beautiful. Compared to T3 this is a very good movie, compared to T1 and T2 not so good. The Special Features are good except that many, maybe most, are devoted to showing that McG, the Director, is a genius. He makes the claim that none of the explosions (and there are a ton (but that's in all the Terminator movies) are just for impact that all contribute to the story; not so in my opinion. For example one massive firefight and explosion when the 'Cyborg' or whatever it is escapes is largely pointless. Moon Bloodgood sustains a minor injury, but otherwise, nada.<br /><br />The so-called 'Director's Cut' is a joke. The only thing in adds is a side view of Moon Bloodgood's breast. McG obviously wants people to think he is the new James Cameron, but he is not. He does do a good job of being much more faithful to the story line than T3 and also sets up more Terminator movies without being too heavy handed. But this is not a classic.<br /><br />By the way, the 'special features' definitely answer the question of whether it is the 'real' Arnold or a CGI 'Arnold.' But you'll have to see it for yourself, I won't spill the beans.
It should really have ended with TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, with the horrific post-apocalyptic future finally averted and that credo "No Fate But What We Make" resounding triumphantly in our ears. At least James Cameron knew better than to muddy up the waters, knew better than to mess up the perfect ending. In Hollywood, though, it's all about milking that cow dry, and the Terminator franchise was too lucrative, much too much of a good thing, to leave alone. Hell, the Governator couldn't turn down a third installment. Except without Cameron helming it and with Nick Stahl's negligible turn as John Connor (and with Arnie no longer looking so spry), TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES came up blah. And they still, still, still wouldn't let it rest.<br /><br />TERMINATOR: SALVATION feels like, looks like, smells like a lead-in to yet further sequels. Putting down the cup of haterade for a sec, I will admit that it's a technically well-executed film. It brims with dazzling special effects, soaks in gritty, ominous atmosphere, and is marked with Sam Worthington's very good performance. It's the story itself that is found wanting. A story with this post-apocalyptic premise, in which the human race is on the verge of obliteration, it should make you want to root for humanity's survival. But, thanks to some weak characterization, I find myself not really giving a toss for anyone except for Sam Worthington's character.<br /><br />If the trailer hadn't already given it away, then the opening sequence, set in 2003, spoilers it but big as death row inmate Marcus Wright (Worthington) signs a contract to have Cyberdyne have its way with his corpse. He does this in exchange for a kiss from Helena Bonham Carter, which would've been a cute moment except that it went by too abruptly. Cut then to the year 2018, and Judgment Day has happened. Everywhere lie the decay and ruins of civilization. The Machines have taken over. This isn't yet the time of John Connor. At this stage he is regarded by what's left of the human resistance as either savior or false prophet. At this stage John Connor is a respected and influential soldier in the Resistance, but, as the movie starts, he comes off as more or less still just one of the guys, just one of the soldiers, even if his peers know all about his perceived destiny. In 2018, John Connor ranks only second on Skynet's hit list.<br /><br />The person Skynet would most like to neutralize is a teenager named Kyle Reese, and even the casual fan is well aware that the Terminator mythos is very dependent on Kyle Reese. However, I don't get the logic in Reese being more crucial for Skynet to stop than John Connor. Connor doesn't know where Kyle is, but we learn that Kyle and a mute little girl comprise the entire Los Angeles-based resistance. Who knows how much longer these two could've waged their losing battle against Skynet's war machines, except that it's around here that Marcus Wright inexplicably resurfaces, asking what day and year it is and seemingly stunned at the rampant devastation stretching to the horizon. Marcus Wright's last memory is being executed in 2003 and his presence now in 2018 has already altered the time line. Elsewhere, John Connor tells his wife: "Something has changed. This is not the future my mother told me about." The only question is whether Marcus is someone from the past or something deployed from the future by Skynet. Either way, Marcus promptly proves to have exceptional survival skills.<br /><br />I liked this movie, liked enough about it that I don't really feel like slamming it too hard. The first two Terminator movies and even the SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES have built up enough good will that, even though I was a bit iffy about this fourth entry, I knew I was gonna be in the theater when it opened up. The story itself isn't all that and feels disjointed in spots. The core narrative follows Marcus Wright, but a key sub-plot involves the Resistance's discovery of a device which emits an override signal and renders the Machines inert. This kill switch is crucial to the Resistance's plan to take the fight directly to Skynet. This is pretty ho-hum stuff to me, and doesn't at all give me what I crave for, which is a series of absorbing character moments involving folks other than Marcus (Marcus has plenty of character moments).<br /><br />Thankfully, the incredibly intense action sequences and the special effects carry the movie, with the CG being wicked spectacular, seamless, really. And I dig the colossal Transforminator! Director McG and his crew really sell the harrowing, dirty, grainy future world and establish that palpable sense of bleakness, that man has lost his place as the dominant species on the planet. Sam Worthington is great, as mentioned, and never mind that his Australian accent peeks out every now and then. The film's emotional core absolutely revolves around the tragic Marcus Wright, and he brings home that central theme of "Do sad robots have souls?" You certainly connect with him more than with the grim and tortured John Connor, and going by the quality of Worthington's performance, AVATAR has got itself a crackling good lead. Anton Yelchin as the teenaged Kyle Reese does a good job of channeling Michael Bienh's mannerisms; he's sure more convincing playing Reese than he is playing Chekov. And to ***SPOILER*** the rest of this sentence, there's a serious fanboy moment when a certain T-800 makes an appearance.<br /><br />When that military defense program known as Skynet achieved self-awareness, who would've thunk it that several of its cyborgs (Marcus Wright & the T-800 from T2) would demonstrate more charisma and soulfulness than would the robotic Christian Bale as John Connor? And someone please tell the guy he's not on the Batman set anymore?<br /><br />TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES taps Kate Brewster as a key figure in the Resistance, except that, here, she does a lot of standing around, and it doesn't help that it's the lifeless Bryce Dallas Howard taking over that role (not that Claire Danes was any great shakes). Moon Bloodgood is sexy but superfluous, and, speaking as a dude, it's irksome that her nude scene was deleted. Absolutely, there's a jarring cut right around before the bandits attack Bloodgood's character, making it very apparent that a huge chunk of scene had been lopped off. The sense is that Bloodgood was supposed to provide a further emotional connection, and possibly even a romantic one, with Marcus. But all that is cut out. The Boy & His Robot theme is offered up again - between Kyle and Marcus, and between the little mute girl and Marcus - but it's not so convincing. And I resent the movie trying to manipulate us even more by introducing the "Newt" element.<br /><br />That old no-nonsense pro Michael Ironside, whom I remember best from the original V mini-series, comes in to provide some much needed fire as the current Resistance leader. So that's good.<br /><br />For someone touted as the savior of humanity, John Connor doesn't really do much until near the end, and so there's a credibility issue here. In the prior films, John Connor was either this shadowy figure lurking in the future or he was portrayed by unremarkable yahoos like Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl and that kid from the TV series. Meaning that, here we are somewhat caught up with the future time line and this is when and where John Connor is supposed to make his mark. He doesn't, and if Christian Bale hadn't insisted on expanding his John Connor role, word has it that the future messiah would've been relegated more to the background, maybe only as a raspy voice broadcasting over the radio, offering hope to the isolated pockets of survivors: "This is John Connor. If you are listening to this - you are the Resistance."<br /><br />And one beef I've always had - but it's minor - is the Terminators' habit of throwing their targets around, instead of just efficiently snapping necks. And - okay, I'm ***SPOILERING*** this sentence - - - when Connor infiltrates the heart of Skynet, he encounters only two Terminators. Two! So, okay, one is supposed to be the very first T-800 model; I guess that's why there's only one of his type. And the second is a T-600. But, dang, this is the heart of Skynet! Where's the rest of its soldiers?<br /><br />I miss Sarah Connor, her presence here relegated to voice recordings frequently consulted by John. But that's how good Linda Hamilton was.<br /><br />SALVATION presents us with a passel of Hunter-Killer war machines (the T-600, T-800, the hydrobot, the self-automated motorbikes, the Infiltration Prototype, etc.) but, probably because this is a PG-13 flick, the threat level isn't as impressive and these metal suckers aren't as frightening. And if you're expecting SALVATION to resolve everything, to provide a capper to the franchise, that doesn't happen. If anything, the hokey ending sets up a new trilogy. And as much as I've been grousing for the past few paragraphs, I'll say again that I like this movie. SALVATION is a gritty war movie as much as it is a sci-fi thriller. It certainly bears repeated viewings for the many very cool fan moments provided, although, okay, a young Kyle Reese doesn't quite pull off the iconic "Come with me if you want to live" line.<br /><br />In 2029, John Connor sends Kyle to 1984 to save Sarah Connor. This story being set in 2018, that's over a decade of stuff to chronicle. Yeah, man, this is gonna be another trilogy; it may even end up being a good one. John Connor still has a chance to convince us as that he IS one righteous mutha and that he's fated to lead humanity. But I still can't help but agree with Linda Hamilton; this thing should've ended with the first two films, with "No fate but what we make" still the relevant rallying cry. TERMINATOR: SALVATION gets 3.5 out of 5 stars from me.
I liked this movie a lot, but I enjoy the TV series much more. It is easier to follow the time-travel elements in the TV series over the movie T-4.<br />I thought it was a great way to weave the transcendent mythos of:<br /> a man/not man coming to save mankind, dying or humanity as he gives them his heart to do so.
Ok, so the "Terminator" films are legend. Arnold, Hamilton and a slew of goofy one liners, chilling murders and mind bending temporal paradox theories really defined a generation for sci-fi. With all of that in my head, I waited with baited breath to see how Christian Bale would handle the Terminator legacy... I was disappointed. I'm not saying I didn't really like the film, but there is more "Transformers" than "Terminator" about it. So, my bottom line: If you like Christian Bale, great action, amazing acting and heart pounding music... you're going to love this movie. I really did like it, but it was definitely NOT "The Terminator."
Now I will start off by saying that I agree with Cameron that the series should have ended with T2.  I didn't and we have T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and the immortal line "Talk to the hand."  TERMINATOR: SALVATION makes a better fit in that it takes us onward in time instead of having endless Terminators come back in time to save/kill John Connor.  It has a serviceable performance by Bale as John Connor.  Moon Bloodgood and Sam Worthington (actually a contender for James Bond) are worth the price of admission.  The CG Arnie (the head on the body of Roland Kickenger -- who is not going to be Conan) looks fake.  A popcorn film and nothing more.  If you are looking for TERIMATOR or T2 you will be disappointed.
The movie is not what I have come to expect from a terminator movie.  I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen.  That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action.  I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.<br /> The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence.  How he sent his father back to his mom.  And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'.  Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing.  I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion.  Just don't expect any action.  It's not a `fun' kill em' all kind of film; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip.
You will not recognize the actors, or so little. Even the cameo of Schwarzenegger is computer-generated. The film does not bring much new data. It seems to be mixing time periods, but it does not matter. The machine world has been experimenting a new generation of robots, partly human (brain and heart, etc) and partly machine to infiltrate the resistance. They are capturing human beings now to create that new army of infiltrators. Logical but not revolutionary, my dear Watson, or is it Sherlock Holmes, I was going to say Shakespeare. Then the resistance has been able to devise a signal that can freeze the machines that are always controlled by come kind of wave. Interesting but only experimented at local level.<br /><br />The new thing though is that the only existing hybrid retains enough humanity to be a machine for the machines, and recognizable as such by them, but with a real loyalty to humans to the point of helping John Connor come into the headquarters of Skynet, the network that controls all the machines, liberate the prisoners there, have a final fight with the impersonation of Schwarzenegger, escape with Kyle Reeves, a key to the future and destroy the place, which is a "given back" for a "given gift" because the military headquarters of the resistance had been destroyed because they tried to send a general air strike on Skynet in San Francisco, a move which was successfully opposed by John Connor and thus did not happen, but the signal these generals had sent to all units had had the effect of being detected by Skynet who had sent their taskforce to clear the place in one big airstrike.<br /><br />This episode, that will have to have a sequel since the salvation is not finished yet and has not reached liberation, ends with the hybrid being, Marcus Wright, giving his human heart to John Connor to save him before John Connors dies of his wounds. That human touch, quite in the style of Jesus giving his life to save humanity is going soft on our emotions and that's its main objective. A few tears please. But all together the story has not advanced a lot, except to prepare an eventual next episode that could be at least the first step towards liberation. But frankly the main danger of humanity today is not machines and an eventual take over from them, which would explain the relative flop of this film. It is more the take over the financial tycoons and traders of Wall Street had been able to perform leading the world nearly to the bottom of the abyss, at least to the brink of it.<br /><br />When I see the anti-machine or anti-technology stand of some in our society particularly among educators, I am amazed. This very week a university professor in education is advising us to take into account as the basis of our reflection the children who only have school at their disposal to acquire school-knowledge. I would like that very acute young man to tell me today what school-knowledge is in the knowledge economy and society, and to point out to me the child (a wolf child I guess, since so far wolves don't have TVs and smart phones) who would have had access to no other source of knowledge than school.<br /><br />These fake social-climbing-and-politically-minded-though-not-politically-correct-except-with-Trotskyites intellectuals were those who refused to use the radio in class, and then who considered television as the killing challenger of school, and now consider that all communication tools have to be banned from schools and universities, first of all smart phones. Yes there are some in our universities who think smart phones are nothing but a means of cheating.<br /><br />This ideology is behind the Terminator series, but it is today very pass&eacute;, very pre-historical, if history started with the GUIs (Graphical Users Interfaces). A highly considered communication expert I read in some paper lately considers that the technological revolution of our time started in the early 1990s. What an ignoramus. I would have sworn the Internet was first successfully tested between Stanford and Oakland, California, in the fall 1969, and that the first GUI was invented by Apple for its first McIntosh, and then by Microsoft with Windows 3.1, both at the beginning of the 1980s. Why should we be afraid of machines? The Matrix was a lot more positive on the subject, even if the tale needs a human sacrifice, a Savior of sorts to conquer peace with machines and to rebut for a while the engineering mind behind it all, behind all the Mr. Smiths of this world.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
Despite some strong acting, this isn't much of a movie.  The next day I couldn't remember how it ended.  But that's not what I want to focus on.  I want to talk about the DVD, not the movie itself.  This pertains to the single-disk widescreen regular DVD edition.  There are only two choices you have on the main menu:  "Play Movie" and "Languages."  No special features.  No scene selections.  Scene selection is a standard function of every DVD I have seen in the last decade.  How could it not be included on this disk??<br /><br />Even worse is the inescapable previews and ads.  This is one of the nastiest tricks studios can put on a DVD.  It is an insult.  Movie previews and ads for video games and graphic novels start playing when you insert the disk.  You cannot escape them.  Press the menu button and you will see something like "This action prohibited in this disk."  Try to jump through them quickly with the Chapter button and you will see the same thing.  You can't get away from them until they're finished.  The ONLY thing you can do is go Fast Forward.  You still can't get rid of them, you still have to see them, but at least it's a little faster.  Years from now if you want to watch this movie on this DVD, you will still have to sit through trailers for movies and products that are then old and probably forgotten.  You want to kick the studio exec who thought this would be a good marketing tool.<br /><br />We should boycott the purchase of this DVD to protest the sleazy marketing techniques of the studio.
I was surprised how much I liked this movie considering all the bad reviews. How can anyone complain about it being too dark or grim? It's post nuclear war, helloooo it's not meant to be a happy, family type of film. Very good sci-fi flick, cant wait for the blu ray in Dec
First off, I can't say Sam Worthington represented a big shock when it turned out he was a Terminator. I mean, they made him up to look like the offspring of a marriage between the original two terminators! They might as well have hung a sign on him!<br /><br />This film is the silliest and most muddled thing I have ever seen. I call this kind of garbage a "gelquel", because it isn't prequel and it isn't sequel except in actual time. To be brief: John Connor (the ever-annoying Christian Bale) is hard at it in the war with Skynet. Inexplicably, his "father", Kyle Reese (a charming Anton Yelchin) is a 16 or 17 year old kid running around alone in Los Angeles. Connor knows he's out there, and that he is a teenager, but....<br /><br />Worthington appears. His determination to "find" someone honks the loud horn that this is a terminator, though as I have said about him before, he is sexy and fun to watch. Not so bad.<br /><br />Forget about trying to understand this over-budgeted time-waster. I'm sure Bale needed the role and the money; Yelchin no doubt needed his role (quite good so naturally it amounts to about 10 minutes total). Worthington needed the exposure as well. That's about it for this thing.<br /><br />All I can point out to the unsuspecting film buff is this movie was less violent and more deserving of a PG than the rotten TRANSFORMERS movie.
Who is this McG dude again? Oh right, he's some douche bag with a ridiculous moniker (McG??????) and has only directed a handful of movies and a couple rap videos. Yep, that's right, we have a guy with almost no experience in film directing a film in a franchise that's very easy to screw up: Terminator. And you know something's up when T3, which was also a piece of crap, starts looking like a good movie in comparison to the newest crappy entry in the series.<br /><br />Christian Bale is in this movie, which is unfortunately a missed opportunity as well. It's no wonder he had a meltdown on the set of this movie- nobody can blame him. This movie is pure muck. I saw this on opening weekend, and walked away as satisfied as much as I was when seeing "9" (in other words, not satisfied). Like I mentioned before, this is a very easy franchise to f--k up, and McG did just that.<br /><br />There's literally nothing to spoil in here. There's basically no plot except something about protecting the universe. The action scenes are very poorly done, with the shaky camera and quick cutting (WHEN WILL DIRECTORS STOP SHAKING THE GODDAMN CAMERA!!!!!!). I could hardly tell what was going on. The acting is awful- except for the excellent performance by Anton Yelchin, who is someone I don't usually like. But even he can't save the movie from sucking out loud. And Sam Worthington is a wasted opportunity here- he was AMAZING in Avatar, and horrible in this too... also, I'm a real Bonham-Carter fanboy, yet she even sucked in this too. The dialogue is terrible ("We have won the battle, but we haven't won the war"??? I think I heard that on an episode of Power Rangers). Yep, you guessed it, this movie sucks out loud.<br /><br />IN TOTAL<br />Violence: Headache/10<br />Sex: 0/10<br />McG: What an idiot/10<br /><br />***Approach with caution***
This episode in the Terminator franchise amounts to nothing more than a music video/video game.<br />It's awful.  It is so far from the 1984 original version in both spirit and style that it may well be a film totally separate from the Terminator.<br />McG, besides having a ridiculous moniker, is a terrible director. He makes Michael Bay look like an artist.<br />The director does not have respect for the moviegoer with adolescent kids shooting Remmington 870s one-handed, rock music inserted into various scenes, exotic chesty babes with hair cascading from their helmets, 20 story robots sneaking up behind victims, to a megalomaniac actor rehashing his Batman demeanor.  Suck defined.<br />A Terminator fan will watch, and will know how awful this film is.<br />Everyone else: you're either a video game playing cretin, a person that likes Transformer films, and/or a NASCAR fan.
Being a loyal fan of THE best terminator of the series (the first one) and having seen the sequels; I set my expectation levels very low for this one; particularly because of the PG-13 rating which reaked of pandering to the mainstream.<br /><br />I have to say... I was shockingly surprised at how enjoyable this movie turned out to be. I don't have to mention how amazing the action sequences were but they were some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. While a few reviews mention the story and editing being choppy, I would have to agree only with the editing. The story linked the past sequels surprisingly well while at the same time creating an alternate future with a whole new subplot involving a whole new character. If you know your T- Series movies.. you know what I am talking about. Little touches throughout the movie added to the nastalgia such as the GNR moment, Arnold coming back (sort of) as the original terminator which looked so real. They literally took shots of the original movie to put arnold back in this movie so he looked just as he did in 1984. Even the scar on John Connor's face (which is in a future scene on T2) was added in the movie when he was scratched by the terminator. Little touches for fans like us made the movie that much more fun to watch.<br /><br />I have to compliment the actors as well. I trully believed these characters would become the actors in the earlier movies especially Kyle Reese. Although, I found myself scratching my head with the little girl who added absolutely no value in the past sequels or this movie's story line.<br /><br />This movie is a must see for T fans and new fans since it can also be watched as a stand alone movie. I was truly surprised at how much fun I had watching this movie, even though it's the first to tone it down with a PG 13 rating. I really wish they would have made it darker and grittier by making an R rating but it does rank as my second favorite in the series.
Blu-ray gets a 2 disc director's cut while dvd gets only a pos single disc with only the theatrical cut.  Getting tired of having some studios try to shove blu ray down my throat by withholding all good special features and added footage.  DVD is still the top selling format.  Wish they'd just give us the quality of discs we used to get.
What's going on?  Why should I care about these characters?  Then I found myself asking why I even care how it ends.  Seriously, try to see this movie without any additional incremental out-of-pocket expenses before you plunk down real money and take up valuable DVD shelf space.
After Terminator 3 a lot of people probably figured the series was over. Arnold was gone, Judgment day happened, what else was left? Terminator Salvation takes on the next logical subject, the war of the future. Salvation's apocalyptic showdown is a bit more tame than the one Cameron originally gave us- unstead of a hellish, black warzone roamed by uncountable armies of terminators, Salvation takes the life after people route as human stragglers hide from roving killer robots in the abandoned derelicts of civilization. The film follows a crew of heroes who come together to battle Skynet, culminating in more of the industrial-warhammer-hell you might have expected.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the biggest stars of Salvation is the special effects work. As much as possible this film uses model work and animatronics SUPPLIMENTED by CG, and it shows. The corny CG of 3 is gone, replaced by believable, gritty mechanized mayhem. This realism cost the film dearly, giving a budget it couldn't really hope to recoup, but it's worth it as an example of what you can do if you don't just rely on computers.<br /><br />The BD looks and sounds fantastic. Unlike the overproduce T3, Salvation has grain in the night shots, tons of detail, and all sorts of rugged post-apocalyptic dirt on actors faces (except the pristine and, in this version, slightly more nude Moon Bloodgood). The terminators in particular look genuinely awesome, although they don't quite achieve the jerky nightmarish appeal of the stop-motion original. Like T3 this movie ONLY has a pop-up menu. There's a good variety of special features and additional footage- some of the restored content, primarily the expansion of some of Marcus' scenes, is a welcome addition to the film, while other bits, such as the aforementioned almost-nudity, seem poorly edited in.<br /><br />Overall, this is a worthwhile buy for series fans and hi-def aficionados, although the slow, moody pace and dependance on past material may put off people new to the series. So if you haven't seen any Terminator films and you're looking at this... Buy all 4. They're cheap now.
The Good:<br />Special effects are in general excellent. Sound design is great if you have a home theatre set-up. I liked the performances of Sam Worthington's and Anton Yelchin and there were a couple of nice little homage's to the first two films - the "come with me if you want to live" line and the nod to Guns and Roses.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Christian Bale - now I know his performance has split the Amazon critics, for me it didn't really work. I found his performance very wooden and he exhibits none of the charisma that I would expect a leader of a resistance movement to have.<br />The Plot - in a nutshell there's too many holes.<br />We never really find out what motivates the Sam Worthington character. He emerges from the ground and starts walking - he tells Kyle Reese that he's heading north - for what? - it's never explained.<br />And why for example does Skynet need to lure John Connor to its base - surely, if it just killed Kyle Reese then Connor would not exist anymore -the film is a bit sketchy on the whole time travel, cause and effect thing anyway. And given that Skynet is using Reese to lure Conor, the whole premise behind Sam Worthingtons character becomes a bit redundant.<br />I know that at its heart it's just a big dumb action movie but I like my dumb action movies make some kind of sense - at least in the context of their own universe.<br />Oh, and John Connor's wife must be one of the most underwritten characters I've ever seen - she literally adds nothing to the movie.<br /><br />In summary, it's not a bad movie - it's certainly better than T3, but it really doesn't stand up to comparison with the first two movies in the franchise.
With a bit of a disappointing movie called 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines', about six years later, we get 'Terminator Salvation'.  To me Terminator Salvation felt more of a Terminator movie than that of T3, and it seemed like the people involved understood the mythology of the Terminator franchise that was made popular by James Cameron.  Unlike the first three movies which involved people or machines going back in time, this time it's set sometime after the future had happened, the Resistance vs Skynet.  While there are somethings that I liked how they went about making nods to the movies done by James Cameron and was interesting how they went about showing that, never expecting the one thing around the end of the movie.<br /><br />The writing is one thing that I think is better with this compared to the third movie and the director McG seemed to understand the franchise better than what I think that Mostow did.  While the future that is envisioned in Salvation may look a little different than what was shown in Cameron's Terminator movies.  With Salvation is in the early stages of the war or that McG wanted to show how the war may have been than that compared to what Cameron had envision for when he done the movies.  Though I never thought that DVD owners wouldn't have a Director's Cut of the movie that was originally made it rated 'R' like the first three, but only thing is that there's only like around two extra minutes added to it.  The extras there isn't that many with the DVD release but a good chance to see some behind the scenes look.  Overall I give it 3.5 stars out of 5.
Two very different movies are happening at the same time in Terminator Salvation, one of which is much more interesting than the other.  Usually when this happens it means that a producer liked a previous draft well enough to keep its elements, but a later writing team couldn't integrate them well enough into the script as a whole for them to make sense.  The first movie stars Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood, as well as Yelchin, and is the more interesting of the two.  The characters are more fleshed out than in the other film, and through Marcus Wright we see an aspect of Skynet that we haven't before.  The second movie stars Christian Bale, and is not nearly as interesting.  In many ways, John Connor is essentially along for the ride.  I don't understand this, given that John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the resistance, and a charismatic leader; you'd think he'd be the focus of the movie.  Bale's Connor is bland and unapproachable, through no fault of Bale; the script gives him very little to work with.<br /><br />On the bright side, there isn't much here that's going to tick you off if you're a fan of the Terminator movies, unlike certain aspects of T3 that made me want to chuck a shoe at my TV.  On the down side, after it's over, my reaction was "huh, so that was it," instead of, "that was really cool."  When a movie with killer robots, time travel, Helena Bonham Carter, a nuclear war, and some Road Warrior cars elicits that kind of response, it has failed in its mission.<br /><br />This is fine as a rental, but I wouldn't add this to my permanent collection.
Earth is destroyed except for a few people and the machines.  John Connor gives Resistance radio pep-talks with all the inspiration of an annual tax form.  Death-row guy discovers that Skynet made him an infiltration Terminator and he screams, "Noooooo!"  Lots of fighting.  Stuff blows up.  Machines buzz.  Connor always escapes as the lone survivor of man-machine slaughtering while death-row infiltration Terminator keeps on fighting to save the day.  Neither man nor machine is deserving of victory and there's no prize for the winner.  It's just two hours of stuff grinding together.
ever since i was a kid i have loved the terminator movies.i remember back in the early 80s being upset at the idea of never having a terminator 2.i remember in the early 90s,being estatic when they made a second part.i remember in the early part of the 2000s loving the 3rd part.<br />  but there were 2 things i really wanted.the first was to not have to wait a decade in between parts.the second was to see the actual man vs machine war.a whole movie dedicated to just that and not existing only in flashes and memories.<br />  well,here it is!it only took about 5 years,maybe less and the war is on!i really liked this movie a lot.it is not nearly as good as the first 3,but it is definately a good movie.<br />  i didnt like a few things but they are minor.one was that i kept seein john connor as bruce wayne.a silly quirk i know.2 of the main characters looked a lot alike.it confused me a bit.the only real issue i had with the story was the innefficient death camp.<br />  john connor,the best hope for mankind and terminator hater extrordinaire,makes a deal with a terminator.that rubbed me the wrong way.hes supposed to hate them so much.<br />  i also didnt like that arnold swarzanegger was in the movie.he was ranked as the number one enemy against guns in the u.s. .  now the hypocrite plays in a movie full of guns?ive lost all respect for that guy.<br />  the general consensus is that this movie is a let down.i say it is NOT a let down,only not as good as it predecessers.<br /><br />one of the female soldiers kisses a  terminator at the end.if machines get her hot,she couldve just stuck her tongue in a toaster.
I've seen this Blu-ray twice, Director's Cut once. The extra three minutes isn't much, but it does add a bit of smoothness to the story. If an extended version ever comes out (late 2010?) I'll be there to get my copy. I also read most of the complaints about this movie in between my two viewings. It didn't make any difference. Thankfully this movie doesn't remind me of T2 that much. Instead I think of Blade Runner and the recent TV series Battlestar Galactica. These are all treatments of similar ideas (replicant androids, and/or dominant robots) which I really enjoy.<br /><br />I'm happy with the story, the casting, the acting ability of the cast, and the state-of-the-art production quality; AND the design and visual concepts, special effects, music, etc., etc. Considering the 118 minute running time, I don't see where a minute was wasted in telling the tale. Some of the complaints I've been reading here are about what more explanation the story needs. The-Powers-That-Be have cut it to its current length. We'll have to wait for a longer version.<br /><br />I don't get all the complaining! One person says there are too many characters and the scope is too large; but T4 is a world war. Other people refer to the original films as being better somehow, and I heartily DISAGREE. I confess! I've never liked Arnold's Austrian-accented "witticisms", and I also did not enjoy him as a "good guy" in T2. T1 was better, but that was a long time ago. Now that everybody has been schooled on the foundations of the Terminator saga, it's time to step up to the next level of the story. T4's director, McG, did just that, and very well, IMO.
Good movie and good details story link with old part. Nice Feature behind the screen in Bluray
Finally, something to make up for the fiasco of T3.  This was a great film! I almost didn't want to see this movie, but I'm glad I did now, and I wasn't disappointed. Lots of story and action going on here, kept me interested in it from start to finish. Christian Bale has become the go-to actor for franchise films, and this one continues in the tradition of the original, with lots more. And even better, the ending was much better than I would have expected, certainly, with the direction it seemed to be going after it was revealed that one of the heroes of the movie was a Terminator, they worked it out into a satisfying, if poignant, ending. And to top it all off, we even got a little bit of "Arnold" in the movie. Brilliant!
I'll start out by saying that I love The Terminator franchise, concepts, and basically the universe of ideas that Cameron spawned within his mind a long time ago.  However, I must say that there were only two things that stopped this review from getting one star rather than two.  One being that Christian Bale was in this movie, as he is one of my favorite actors, however is performance here was lacking.  The second would be the special effects which were very well done.  The rest of the movie though basically sucks, as did T3.  The rest of the cast sucks, even B.D. Howard, and they give a third rate performance.  And the plot?  Don't get me started.  Where is the continuity here?  Fox's "The Sarah Connors Chronicles" keeps continuity more in line, stemming from T2.  T3 sucked so bad that it doesn't even count.  Thank God for special effects and Bale, or this film could have been T3 part two.  We can always think...what could have been.<br />Peace and Love,<br />Jake
Ordered this for my husband for Christmas - he was very excited!  Exactly what I ordered and I received it very quickly!
The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.<br /><br />2/4
Movie does well on its own.  The sound on the blu ray is some of the best I've heard, Transformers1-2, Dark Knight, Iron Man, the picture is great but the movie looks a bit drab, it's meant to look like this I assume.  The director's cut is the best way to watch the movie as the original has some poor editing.  Kyle Reese is played well but I did not care for Moon Bloodgood.  Good not Amazing.
It's hard to know how to rate these releases at times. Do you base it on the movie alone? The DVD/Blu-Ray release? I'll have to do the movie and dvd seperate in this review because the grades are different.<br /><br />The Theatrical Cut is a decent movie. It feels like T3 (which might not be so good to some of you) in the way that a lot of story feels cut. Sometimes it feels like a scene or two is missing. The story, what little there is of it, makes for a decent movie, but could be so much better. Something tells me that James Cameron would have done so much more, but that's movies these days, little story, lots of CGI. Though I must confess I liked Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. What made it to the movie story-wise was decent, but again could be a lot better. It feels like all sizzle and no steak. I'd have to give the movie a B-<br /><br />The DVD release is highly disappointing. No EXTRAS! Nothing. Not a trailer, commentary or anything that I'm used to with buying dvds. Unfortunately, it seems you have to get blu-ray or else be left behind. I love movies too much to settle for bare bones dvds like this. I think it is an awful way to treat customers and thst the industry is shooting themselves in the foot. Standard DVD will die it's natural death like VHS and everything else before. Why force it? Why risk turning fans against you when you force an issue by not releasing the standard extras? I just think they should let standard dvd fade away, but this is not an industry that is fan friendly. How many times do they release dvds like this only to release the special edition or whatever so fans have to double-dip or just lose out. This DVD release gets an F- from me. Lowest possible score. Rent it. Don't buy. Wait for some far off future re-release anniversary, special edition, blu-ray, anything but this. The companies involved should feel ashamed at themselves for ripping fans off. But they don't. It's all about the money.
I have really liked the the first three movies, even the goofy third. This one was difficult to follow. The individual acting was good with very nice especial effects. However, the plot was really simple with few surprises and figuring out why some of the important characters were important was distracting. It turns out that aside from Conner and Reese, they weren't. Not really. Then, we have the end. I felt it was straining for some deep moral/ethical statement, but just struck me as empty, loose and amateurish. I think it's really time to Terminate this series :)
It 2018 and Judgement Day has happen the war between man and machine raged on for years, but on man Marcus Wright doesn't know anything about it, all  he remembers is being put to death for killing two men. Coming to Los Angeles, Marcus meet Kyle Reese and a girl named Star. Across Califoria for told leader of the resistance John Conner is battling the machine and those in command who don't belive that Conner will in the end lead the humans to victory. But Conner's and Wright's path are going to cross with a shocking discovery that may the eend mankind for ever and cost Conner his life.<br />"Terminator Salvation" is the lastest installment is a Terminator Saga and as good as the second movie. Christian Bale plays John Conner just right as a man who has a great burden is trying to help others survive, when he couldn't stop Judgement Day from happen. Sam Wentworth is also great a man who trying to make-up for past sins. Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't get much screen time as John's Kate, a role she took over from Claire Danes. Moon Bloodgood plays Blair Williams a fighter pilot who begins to have feelings for Wright even after she learns who and what his is. Director McG doess overall great job with the movie giving a the audience lots of action. The DVD itself could have been better. There are no extra features, we can only hope that they will be  second release of the DVD that will have some extras in the future.
John Connor could not prevent Judgment Day from happening; he could only delay it. Now the war has arrived, and John (Christian Bale), along with his wife (Bryce Dallas Howard) and any other surviving humans they run across are part of the Resistance, a group fighting for survival against the machines.<br /><br />Marcus (Sam Worthington) is part man, part machine, a rejuvenated murderer who was put to death before Judgment Day. The machines created him to combat the Resistance, but his human soul makes him loyal to that side of himself. After sneaking into a base, John Connor orders him to be destroyed, but an amorous female (Moon Bloodgood) helps him escape. Marcus barters with John; he will infiltrate Skynet to save Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), John's father.<br /><br />As a stand-alone movie, Terminator Salvation is a mediocre action movie which follows a formula set up by others of the genre. It has exciting moments, its predictable moments, and boring stretches. However, as a member of the Terminator series, it is incredibly disappointing, and has such a different mood, it stands out like a wrong note.<br /><br />Somehow the post-apocalyptic world does not seem as scary and desolate as it did in Reese's flashbacks in T1. There is too much daylight in this movie, and the Resistance has too many resources. Furthermore, these actors' renditions of famous lines from the previous films come out cheesy and cheap, like the film makers just threw them in to keep fans happy.<br /><br />There are also several continuity problems. How does Alice in Chains begin playing in the Jeep after Marcus hot wires it? I find it hard to believe that a CD, let along a car, survived the nuclear explosions, but lets just assume they did. How, then, does Guns and Roses play over the radio when there isn't a radio station around to broadcast it? Also, how did Sarah Connor's tapes survive Judgment Day? I found it annoying too that they've been re-recorded, although audio obviously exists of them from previous films.<br /><br />I find it rather annoying that the cast changes with each film; maybe the film makers should take a hint when all of their stars refuse to reprise their roles. The characters seem very shallow in comparison to the previous films. We have spent years getting to know them, John Connor particularly, and suddenly he's completely different, a hardened shell of who he used to be. Bale plays the part like he never saw the other movies in the series, which is made all the more obnoxious because he is a celebrated "Method" actor. His involvement seems is a gross miscasting. The most fascinating character is Reese, who is a bit of a mystery anyway, but if a sequel is made (and I hope one isn't), let's hope Reese is the focus.
While I agree the movie is OK if you are above the age of 15; however, I share the disappointments with Warner Bros.'s disregard for suppling their CLIENTS with the normal, expected Dig Copy advertised.  IT IS NOT INCLUDED and you have to go on-line, down load the instructions onto your own media, then follow the instructions to finally say something you sincerely hope the kids did not over-hear. For me, who installs multi-user accounting applications, grew wary with everything that had to be done in hopes that my son may get the dig copy by Christmas.  As if the holidays aren't stressful enough!<br /><br />Disneys/Pixar's UP, FOX/20th's Museum @ Smithsonian, Paramount's STAR TREK, etc. digital copies were all INCLUDED inside the package, along with activation codes.  SIMPLE, getting what you're paying for!  I like that - a LOT!<br /><br />However, I agree with a lot of other reviewers:  We consumers are getting nickel & dimed to death with taxes (ok, wont go there), with upgrades that should have just been offered at the get-go.  But to continue to buy multiple copies of the same movie to get an alternate ending, deleted scenes, director's what nots is getting tiresome.  MS has built an empire perfecting this.  I urge the struggling movie industry to just DO THE RIGHT THING:  Give us what we want right from the get go, it is worth the extra buck.  My life can't be revolve around a movie!?  I'll just keep watching Star Trek and Battle at the Smithsonian movies.  BOTH ARE EXCELLENT and I received EXACTLY what I "thought" I was buying.  As the kids' say:  Awesome!<br /><br />KIS,S
Terminator 4 is not per se a bad movie, but its not a very good one.  The problem lies with the director's choices which parallel the scripts choices, that is, the concentration on machines.  The director is far more interested in the special effects and creating the bleak environment of post-judgment day using computers and machines than the characters themselves.  Similarly the script is more interested in the "fake" terminator of Marcus than in John Connor or humanity.  Though I don't want to reference the great earlier terminator movies, what's was crucial to the story is that it was humanity struggling to survive and fighting to prevent the future.  Sadly, this movie loses both of these things, being set in a time where the future was created, with characters are two-dimensional at best.  Why does John Connor fight the machines?  He doesn't seem to have any actual desire to fight, but only does so because its what he was told to do.  Similarly the soldiers are largely emotionless and uncaring, not interested in doing anything but destroying things.  Oddly the only character who has even a little humanity is a machine, marcus.  Sadly, I didn't really care about him as there is no real reason to, other than he's the protaganist of the story.  Sadly this movie reminds me of how I felt watching arnold as the first terminator, it was tense, dark, and muscular, but completely lacked any feeling.<br /><br />As to the blu-ray, I feel there is going to be a double dip down the line, as there are very few features, and the ones that exist aren't that great.  However, the picture looks pretty great, especially the effects.  Maybe worth renting, but I can't see it in my collection.
Really impressed with this version! I hope and look forward to christian bale in the future..the variety of terminators in this is great and as in any sci fi our humanity is highlighted Good and bad.
Ok. Finally a good movie of 2009. Ironic that the dvd itself is weak. The crappy Transformers sequel and Star Trek movies get great treatment but this excellent movie does not???<br /><br />Anyway.....<br /><br />This movie is excellent. Great story of redemption. The character Marcus is a death row inmate then changes and becomes hero to mankind, saving John Connor in the end. He gets his second chance at life.<br />There are many great nods to the other movies. You see how John Connor gets his scar seen in the very first movie. You see the T-800s as they come out of the factories(has the Arnold look), great touch to the 1984 movie.<br />There is lots of action too and many different versions of the enemy, from snake like to King Kong sized to the evil looking T-600s.<br />I reccomend this to any Terminator fan.<br />4 stars for the actual movie and 1 star for the poor dvd release. This was the best action movie of the 2009 summer.<br />No crude sex jokes or complete insult to the franchise.<br />Just great sci fi action.<br />This won't disappoint.
I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!
This movie was sub-par. It was just called Terminator to sell tickets. I didn't enjoy more than half of this movie. It was OK. But the other three where so much better. For those of you who scoffed at T3, I think after you saw this one you where probably more grateful for T3 than you had been. Let's hope, since they did take in a little bit of a profit, if you factor in the worldwide total, let's hope the next one is better. Let's hope they get better writers and a better director and a better soundtrack. I'd hate to see the Terminator franchise meet its own Judgement Day.<br /><br />I think my favorite part about this movie wasn't the movie itself but Christian Bale's on set tirade.<br /><br />I give this movie a 3/10. Sorry...<br />It grows on you a little but, mostly it disappoints.
Blu-ray is great, but there's no reason why the few extra minutes found in the Director's Cut couldn't make it to the DVD.  It's not like a different form of media like DVD was to VHS.  Both DVD and Blu-ray are digital.  The difference?  Blu-ray can hold more data.  They look and sound better - great - but is that a reason why you have to make that the ONLY way to own the Director's Cut?<br /><br />Now, I really wanted to buy the Director's Cut DVD of this film, but it will only be on Blu-Ray.  Does the studio think I'm going to buy a Blu-Ray player just for 'Terminator Salvation?'  LOL no.  I didn't even do that for 'The Dark Knight.'<br /><br />So, all the studio is doing is losing money by forcing me to have to download the Director's Cut, rather than purchase the DVD (which I wanted to do, since I have all of the other 'Terminator' films).  So, it looks like they'll be losing a lot of money with this stupid stunt of theirs.  People who don't have Blu-Ray aren't going to buy a player just for a movie like this, so this was a bad idea.  Instead, people who want to see the Director's Cut are just going to find alternative methods to do so, which will completely cut the studio out of the profit.<br /><br />Good going.<br /><br />(I just wanted to update this review to say that I've fully embraced Blu-ray but I don't like how extras/Director's Cuts don't always come on both formats!)
After watching this 4th of the Terminator series, it is clear to me that James Cameron was the key reason behind the Terminator series's success. McG, the director of this film, seems to be gifted in action sequences but rather poor in editing.<br /><br />Everyone knows that very few films will ever measure up to the first two Terminator films. The 2nd Terminator (Judgement Day) still ranks as one of the greatest action movies of all time and the 1st Terminator does not rank too far behind. This is an entertaining film which will unfortunately forever be compared to the first 2 films. This film falls short of the first two.<br /><br />The best portion of this film are the action sequences. The Mad Max like thrilling action sequences are breathtaking. This Terminator film brings back much of the old school special effects using real stuntman (not CGI) to perform very dangerous yet entertaining stunts.<br /><br />The film suffers from a noticeably bad editing. The sequences do not flow well in many scenes. For example, the scenary between the Blair Williams and the thugs are shown abruptly right after Marcus Wright and Blair developes a romantic chemistry. The scene which a human prisoner is shot by a T-600 is best described as choppy.  You will notice more than few sequences in which few hours of filming seemed to have been condensed into few seconds.<br /><br />The storyline is also very choppy as well. It appears Dr. Serena Kogan's role has been changed many times. That's too bad since I think Serena's role could have been a pivtol and a fascinating one. Perhaps Marcus Wright's original role has been altered more than a few times. The storyline is not entirely coherent.<br /><br />Moon Bloodgood, who plays Blair Williams, was the most convincing actor. Sam Worthington has proven himself to be a bonifide action star. And Christian Bale has done nothing to derail his action star status.<br /><br />Perhaps the director McG tried too hard to condense this film into under 2 hours. I think the film would have benefited from another 15-25 minutes and a more consistent storyline.<br /><br />Lastly, I think this Terminator film does not portray the post Judgement Day human suffering well at all. Where are the starving and wretched human existence? Does John Connor's greatness reside primarily in his knowledge of the Skynet and the Terminators?
One of the best movies to come out of 2009, Terminator Salvation was exactly what the franchise needed to reinvigorate itself.  2003's Terminator 3 did for this franchise what the Maginot Line did for France in WWII: Nothing.  In fact, I'd hazard to guess the Maginot Line was at least a passive failure while Terminator 3 fell more along the lines of "Is there any possible way I can remove my rectum through my mouth?" type of epic failure.<br /><br />Thankfully, Terminator Salvation rectifies this.  While not as action packed as its three predecessors, we are finally introduced to John Connor, whose very existence has been the crux of the Terminator dogma.  Exploring the initial structure of the human resistance, and its looming possibility of schism, truly gave one a sense of the scattered and desolate nature of humanity.  It also showcases a stage in the ever-changing evolution of Skynet and its slow, rumbling path towards human extinction.  Skynet isn't everywhere yet and the resistance, while holding out, still lacks the momentum, and personnel, to truly strike any critical blows against its AI antagonist.  This sets up a very well-written story and poses the question "What truly makes us human?"<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer enhances the visual and audio experience and makes this installment a new and worthy torchbearer for the franchise.  I would highly recommend this title to anyone.
I decided to rent it first because I wasnt 100% sure about if this movie was any good.<br />In my humble opinion, this didnt hold a candle to the first 2 Terminator movies..it was flat. Completely flat. Like watching a blank TV screen for 2 hours.<br />It lacked any of the ingredients that made the first 2 superior films. Even the 3rd Terminator film was better than this dribble. The film really just dragged for me and didn't have enough plot or story to hold my interest. This was another 2009 movie that spends a lot for explosions but zero on characterization. The characters were unlikeable & just bland to show any real interest. Who knew John Connor would be a boring/bland character as an adult ?<br />Sure there are a few moments with the Terminator robots going after the characters (what was Christian Bale thinking??) but it wasn't much. It was a whole lot of nothing going on. Even the naked "Schwartzenegger" Terminator running around trying to kill Connor wasn't anything special<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be that great a governor but at least the Terminator movies he did had substance, a good story and a director who knew what it takes to make a good science fiction futuristic story with characters to root for a care about. If they make another Terminator film it should be directed by James Cameron in other words.<br />I would only see it if you like the Terminator series & are curious to see this one.<br />They shouldn've really stuck at 2 to be blunt..
I have to disagree with the critics when they cut this film down.  First off, yes, they will probably never make a terminator film as good as T2 again.  However, this film was very entertaining.  It was a really nice spin to add another substantial character to the mix.  The story was good, special affects amazing and acting was great.  The action sequences were nicely done as well.  The Blu Ray looked just as good as I remember in the theater and comes with a nice amount of extras considering the cheap price it's selling for.  Don't expect alot from the added three minutes.  There were a couple small scenes I noticed and the rest were indiscernible.  Looking forward to T5.
I saw Terminator: Salvation in theaters and I was extremely disappointed in how the origional story line that James Cameron created, went right down the toilet.<br /><br />Here are the major issues I have with this movie:<br /><br />  1. In Terminator 2 and even Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles, Sarah ALWAYS told John to run when he saw a machine. He is too important for the future. What do they have John doing in this movie? They have him on the front lines hunting the machines.<br />  2. Who is the leader of the human resistance? John Conner. Why is he reporting to superiors and taking orders from them? Who fricking knows. John should be giving orders, not taking them and having others report to him.<br />  3. Who is John's father? Kyle Reese. Do the machines know who John's father is? According to the first film, NO. All records were destroyed during the nuclear war, the machines had no clue who Conner's father was, but yet somehow Reese's name ends on the top of a list that the machines are targeting for termination. Then the machines find Reese, but don't terminate him. WTF? If the machines aquired their target, they would have terminated him ASAP, they would not have taken him to the work/slave farm.<br />  4. For those that have see Terminator 3, towards the end John asks the T-800 (Arnold) why he wasn't alive in the future and that his wife sent the T-800 back. The responce was: because of the emotional connection John had with the T-800 model when he was younger (Terminator 2) he infiltrated his base and killed John. Now in Terminator: Salvation John faces the new T-800 model, with a digitally imposed Arnold body. Does John die? No, he lives, but the laws of physics are completely shattered during the fight. John shoots a hole in a basin that has melted metal in it. It's pretty much molten lava. It spills on the T-800 and completely covers it, but the T-800 survives and contines coming after John. Wait a minute, didn't a T-800 and the T-1000 get destroyed in melted metal at the end of Terminator 2? Major screw up there if you ask me. Anyway, back to T4, the T-800 is after John, so he shoots a pipe, it bursts and splaches liquid nitrogen on it. The T-800 is frozen, but not defeated, because it breaks free and continues after Conner. Ok, so let me get this straight, the T-800 is covered in molten lava then frozen very quickly after and it can still move? Highly unlikely. If you know anything about going from extreme heat to extreme cold, especially with metal, it explands, then contracts and becomes brittle. So the T-800 would have been stuck because the joints would not have been able to move and Conner would have had an easy victory by beating the head and destroying the chip.<br /><br />There are to many continuity issues from the origional James Cameron films that just don't follow into this forth installment. As far as I'm concerned, this forth film doesn't belong in the story line. If they continue with the series, they need to fix the errors they made otherwise, they will just ruin it for me.
People who have grown up with the Terminator franchise go to see these movies not only for the action, but for storyline.  In all Terminator movies (yes this includes number 3) except this one, the action is not the driving force in the story, rather a compliment.  Perfect example of this is in T2, this movie is not about an awesome liquid metal robot (he is awesome).  T2 is about how a machine at times can be more human than us, so this is a character study.  That is my big criticism with T4, it is a good action movie but thats it, there is no story.  I did not care if John connor lived, and if you don't care if the "saviior" of mankind lives, than there is something wrong here.  I felt as if I was watching someone playing a video game.
I dont care what naysayers or even critics who get paid to criticize the film, this IS a worthy sequel. Sure it aint the same without Arnold being there throughout the movie but ever since watching flashbacks of the future war in the previous installments, id say it was about time that someone made a film that shows what happens next after judgement day happend. If you watch closely, you would notice more than one homage to the first two films. From seeing the ruins of observation area where the first terminator arrived in T1, Marcus showing Reese how to handle a shotgun by tying a string to it which Reese did in T1 to help hide his gun in his trenchcoat, to a similar chase scene with a truck & the motor-terminators lookin like the first chace scene in T2, and even John Connor playin ( You Could Be Mine)<br />by Gun's N Roses to lower a motor-terminator into a trap etc. Anton Yelchin really impressed me as a young Kyle Reese throughout the film just as Sam Worthington played a great cyborg who later finds out he's a pawn to eliminate mankind. Christian Bale pulled off John Connor well himself. As for Moon Bloodgood, Common, & Bryce Dallas Howard i would say it was unfair to discredit them when they didnt get that much screen time. But anyways, if you're a true terminator fan you will enjoy this film. Especially the climax that leaves you wondering what awaits John connor in further battles. Keep in mind that the film takes place in the early years of the war and if you still dont like it, stick to the Terminator: TSCC tv series instead if thats more your taste.
What a great film! Blu ray is awesome! Not only great film and sound but tons of extra's that give a great couple hours enjoyment.
This movie totally sucks.  I felt like I was watching Transformers or some other stupid movie.  No Arnold; No linda.  Did the people making this movie ever see the 1984 original Terminator movie; I think not.  C'mon terminator motorcycles and water creatures?? What's up with that?  The only interesting part of the movie was a truely unique 1 of a kind terminator; interesting concept but the whole idea could have been better developed.<br />Total waste of time and money.  Skip this at all costs if you are a Terminator fan.  If you like cheap sci-fi flicks and/or Transformers then this is right up your alley.  I only give it 1 star because I can't give it a Zero
They should have stopped at T2, but the cash cow can always be milked to death. I loved the first 2, but they went downhill from there. From T1 Kyle Reese said the first terminators had rubber skin, and were easy to spot. In this one they have never even seen a terminator with skin on it, rubber or real.There were many plot holes and really bad cheesiness like" Oh his heart cant take it." "Then please take mine." So if you like your action dark and hard to see with some big explosions added in. Mix in no plot or characters that you give a rats ass about. Then this is the movie for you.
The movie gets one star only because I can't give it less. Transformers was Shakespeare in terms of writing compared to this crap. Was this written and edited by a 12 year old?  Or is this the mean mentality they think viewers have?  The previous Ts were enjoyable movies because they didn't expect a lot of you and you didn't expect a lot from them and they did not insult your intelligence -- they kept it simple.<br /><br />If you haven't figured it out in the first 10 minutes, the moment you see Michael Ironside you should have a clear idea of what you are in for. This movie sucks, simple as that.<br /><br />The writing is beyond poor, I am shocked this has been positively reviewed at all. Did people see a different movie than I did?  In this movie: everyone yells; people do the stupidest things that make ZERO sense just to propel an action sequence or some ludicrous plot device; every cliche you could ever groan about is crammed in at every conceivable opportunity; the big monster robots come with a soundtrack from War of the Worlds -- complete with people collection cages (yawn); strangers will immediately give up precious food if you have a cute kid with you (who conveniently carries a tummy pack overflowing with little 3M bandaids (to put on the strangers little scratch so we feel their "bond"); oh, and if said stranger comes up to you and takes your gun but won't tell you anything about them, by all means you should immediately take them to get a vehicle (because they are so easily attainable), oh and if you by chance happen to turn on the radio (?) well the first song that will come on will be something 'special' to him; and, finally don't forget to ask him to be your leader, so what you have had no other dialogue between you and you don't know anything about him and you live in treacherous times...<br /><br />I kept leaning over and asking: is this really this dumb?  Yes, it really was that dumb. Waste.
In Mad Max there was a guy named Max, and we got to see some stuff about him, his life, and the world he lives in, and at least some of us came to like him, respect him, and maybe even admire him, so that when his wife and kid get brutally murdered it's not just a random act of violence like we see on TV, or read about in papers every day.<br /><br />The people most responsible for Terminator Salvation do not appear to understand this, and maybe someone should tell them.<br /><br />It's less a film than an ad for action figures.<br /><br />Were there any action figures?  I know 7-11 had cups.  I doubt they sold very many.  And I'm positive they didn't have any 5-story tall terminator machines that could sneak up on people in the middle of an arid wasteland.
First of all I absolutely LOVED the 1st movie, *kinda* liked the 2nd, and DESPISED the 3rd. I don't actually care why other people gave this movie bad reviews (to each his/her own) but I have had someone tell me they thought Terminator Salvation was "too dark".<br /><br />Well yeah... That's the type of movie it's meant to be--post-apocalyptic and all. This was the future I've been hungry to see ever since Reese's flash-backs from the 1st movie and I'm glad it wasn't just another excuse to show off some cute smart-mouthed kid actor, etc... This one was gritty, which is really something I happen to dig in sci-fi movies.<br /><br />Sometimes the reviews don't do justice. See it for yourself and decide whether or not you like Pepsi ads and Guns n Roses or a dark, moody thriller and, uh, more Guns n Roses...
The Terminator Saga has been one of the most recognizable in science-fiction film lore and for good reason. The idea of timeline manipulation and the impending machine rebellion (which we all know is coming, right? :)) have cemented this franchise into the hearts of movie-goers for over two decades. The fourth installment finally allows us to partake in the story that, up until now, we have only glimpsed at, the actual post-apocolyptic battle between man and machines. This movie screams epic from start to finish with some of the most intense action and special effects I have ever seen. The story is awesome and really pays a lot of homage to the previous films (well, not really much to the 3rd movie wich I thought, while the weakest of the four, was still decent and had a great ending). On a semi-personal note, I wish the story had remained a little more focused on Conner and a little less on Marcus. Conner is the main protagonist in the 2nd-4th films and it seemed like Marcus was really the only character they spent extensive time building. You can tell that the writers assumed the viewer already knew John Connor well. The attention seemed split about (55% Connor and 45% Marcus.) This isn't a huge gripe by any means as they still did a great job. Overall this is a fantastic action/sci-fi movie and fine addition to the Terminatore cannon. I hope they continue the sage but we'll have to wait and see.
I guess this is one of those movies that people either love or hate. I should first off I have hated pretty much every movie McG has ever directed til now. This is his calling IMO and it's a shame people are ripping the movie apart I think more because of the director then anything. Sort of like Paul W.S Anderson who made a great sci fi flick in Event Horizon but like McG gets tons of hate so people piss on that movie as well as a result.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is not ground breaking. It's not the greatest action sci fi movie ever made and no it's not as a good as the original or T2 but what it does do is open the series up to a whole new dimension by taking it into the future which is something some of us have been wanting to see for awhile now. It delivers on the action and the story is entertaining.<br /><br />The reason I gave the comparisons I did was because it fit. During the scenes when Sam Worthington first walks into the bombed out cites it very much reminded me of the game Fallout 3. Now to someone who has not played the game this won't make much sense but to me it makes perfect sense and brought a smile to my face. The T-600 reminded me of Super Mutants from the game. The Transformers aspect is obvious and I love the sound the giant robot Terminators make. Quite horrific and very fitting. The Road Warrior aspect plays a role as well in addition to throwing in obviously some of the feel from the other 3 Terminators.<br /><br />Story wise I don't want to give away anything as I am not a fan spoilers but the ending was very satisfying and brought a huge smile to my face.<br /><br />Again this movie is enjoyable delivered what I wanted from it. I really do think the negative reactions to this movie is part hate for McG and part over hyping and wanting something else from the movie instead of taking it for what it was, escape for two hours with a fun filled action ride.<br /><br />As far as the bluray goes the sound and picture quality are both fantastic and for the current price of $15.99 you really can't go wrong.
I'v enjoyed all 4 films.  The only thing I notice missing from Salavation was the pacing was off.  The first 3 films(yes, even the 3rd) kept up that relentless, stalking, edge of your seat type pacing that the 4th film just lacked.<br /><br />In terms of quality of production, acting, effects, it's top notch. It just doesn't flow as well as the earlier films.<br /><br />So in my opinion it would come in 4th behind the previous films. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it or thought it was bad.......just not quite the experience for me as the earlier films.  Will still buy it though when it comes out on Blu-Ray<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next film.  Bring it on!
I want to add two things:<br />first, early into the movie, the sequences in which John Connor tries to escape a trap of the terminators by driving a helicopter and gets shot down, obviously imitate the sequences of Children of Men in which Julian gets shot in a car. Indeed, McG expressed his admiration to that movie in an interview for this movie. But the interaction between the helicopter and its environment is not strong enough. Therefore the so-called "you-are-there" feeling abates. In addition, because the way those sequences are shot is not the style of this movie's cinema photography, they seem to be abruptly tucked into the movie.<br /><br />Second, the fighting scene between human and terminator in a factory, as a climax, happens yet again. Perhaps it's a solution to the series' previous instalments but isn't it repeated too many times?
As much hype as this film got, especially the nonsense with Christian Bale berating a lighting guy for causing him to fluff<br />his dialogue during a scene, it didn't even come close to being half way  decent.<br />  The high hopes Halcyon had for this film fell way short and actually caused their demise, disappointing fans that have eagerly awaited the future war for over twenty years.<br />  The only way this franchise will ever survive is to get back to the original plot basics, bring Cameron back on board, much like Ridley Scot has just done with Alien and give the die hard fans what they want.
Terminator "Lite"<br /><br />Very mild spoiler alert...<br /><br />The title of Terminator: Salvation is a contradiction-in-terms (or a promise of false hope...), in that this Terminator film will not be the "salvation" of the Terminator franchise, for there is something lacking in this fourth installment of the Terminator series.... And that is the vision and technical expertise and guiding hand of James Cameron... TS director McG is no James Cameron...<br /><br />The first two Terminator films are modern classics-there is nothing in either film which does not contribute to the clockwork precision of their plots, which exhibit flawless logic... There is also a sense that the epic significance of the events depicted in the first two films is not present in TS-which ends with the promise of a sequel...<br /><br />This film should have been the penultimate tale of the war between Skynet and the ragtag human resistance-but it gets caught up in unnecessary subplots and implausible developments... Major characters do exceedingly dumb things in TS...There are spectacular action set-pieces alongside jaw-dropping, "why would anyone do that" stupidities...<br /><br />In this Terminator film, T-600's fight like humans... Unbelievable! Realistically, if a T-600 got it's hands on a human, it wouldn't waste time punching or throwing, it would simply and instantly kill him... Plus, there are far too many scenes in the film reminiscent of Spielberg's War of the Worlds... Especially with the "harvesting humans" sequence...<br /><br />The story told in TS is in no way original or thought-provoking or awe-inspiring-as were the first two Terminator films, in spades! The breathless, euphoric  feeling I left the theater with after the first two films was not with me after seeing TS... The climax of TS is a huge letdown, with several incredulous developments relating to the human heart... TS is a dumb film, far too dependant on frenetic, extended, CGI action sequences to mask the insubstantial, illogical aspects of it's plot...<br /><br />Christian Bale's John Conner should have been the focus of the film throughout, but he isn't... TS is essentially an ensemble film... Bale did far better work in a far superior film, with a similar dystopian theme and setting: Reign of Fire. The other characters in the film are never fully developed-especially Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogen of Cyberdine, who is seen in a short prolog set before Judgement Day, and then-towards the end of the film-as the face of Skynet... Why? Remember Zemeckis' Contact? McG did... I would like to have seen more of  the relationship between Conner and his pregnant wife, Kate, played by Bryce Dallas Howard-but we learn nothing more than they are quite fond of each other... The subplot featuring Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright and Moon Bloodgood's Blair Williams starts out promisingly, but quickly becomes a detriment to the film's plausibility... Star Trek's Anton Yelchin (Chekov) is quite good as Kyle Reese, the true "McGuffin" driving the plot of TS...<br /><br />For the first half or so of Terminator: Salvation I was caught up in the story being told, the unsatisfying denouement of the film brought me back to Earth... And I felt cheated yet again by another mediocre installment in a series which began so wondrously...<br /><br />Grade C.
If you want to watch a great movie where things blow up, watch "Transformers" as at least it's more colorful and exciting.<br />If you want to watch a great Christian Bale movie, watch "The Dark Knight" or "Batman Begins."<br />If you want to watch a great robot movie, watch "Wall*E."<br />If you want to watch a great Terminator movie, watch one of the first two.<br /><br />This lousy excuse for an action film fails in every way, creating a "story" that is solely meant to cash in on the word "Terminator."  Watching it feels like being stuck watching someone you don't like playing a video game that you don't like.  I wouldn't take this movie if they offered it for free.  If you're a die-hard fan of the original series, you will be extremely let down, but fortunate to not have paid money to see this in theaters (like I did.)  You can disagree with me if you'd like, but if you do, you obviously would not have seen many other action movies and certainly never have seen the original two films.  Even the short-lived FOX television show was better.<br /><br />You've been warned.
The Terminator films have always demanded that its viewers exhibit an above-average "disbelief suspension."  Each incarnation of the series up to now has embraced the possibility of time travel with the caveat that only live matter or matter encased in live matter can make the journey (not to mention "dead" hair and fingernails attached to live matter).  And, of course, there's the liquid metal introduced in T2 and carried over into T3.  Although there's no time travel in "Terminator Salvation," an above-average suspension of disbelief is still required.<br /><br />In this outing, John Connor is not "THE" resistance leader, but merely "A" resistance leader, one who is not even privy to what those at the top of the human food chain are doing or planning.  While on an ill-fated mission at the beginning, he discovers that the machines are kidnapping humans and, later, learns that they are being taken to Skynet HQ in San Francisco.  One of the kidnapped humans, he finds, happens to be Kyle Reese, his father (originally played by Michael Biehn in "The Terminator") who is only a teenager in this particular future.  He learns about Kyle from a character named Marcus Wright, played by Sam Worthington, who you'll immediately question the "humanness" of, which was probably intentional on the part of the filmmakers.<br /><br />While the plot of the film is--along with the acting and special effects--worthy enough to make this an above-average sci-fi movie, there are a few details that prompt some head scratching.  In many parts of the movie, gigantic terminators (land-based or airborne) are shown.  With such "beings" about, it's a little surprising that any shed in the desert hasn't been pulverized along with just about every other building that could shelter a human.  Add to that the fact that John Connor operates a fairly large resistance base replete with helicopters and fighter jets, all unbeknownst to the high-tech eyes of the machines.<br /><br />Whether or not you dwell on this type of thing (or notice it to begin with), "Terminator Salvation"  will probably fit your bill for high-budget, sci-fi action-adventure.  Recommended.
Well, this week I've watched three recently released action films.  And in my opinion, CGI is just over the top!  Movies just don't look real anymore.  They look just too animated and kind of fake.  I just watched the new Star Trek, G. I. Joe, and this new fourth installment of The Terminator saga.  The action scenes are now more intense, unrealistic, and overwhelming.  There is so much LESS story, human interaction, compassion, and drama, and MORE visual screen consuming effects.  They even had a computer animated Terminator of Arnold Schwarzennegger.  This goes to show that pretty soon, movies won't even need actors anymore.  Computer animators will create new movie stars (heroes and villains).  Technology, again, is removing the human element of upcoming future jobs and physical social interaction.<br /><br />And, about the argument about Blue-Ray over the standard DVD:  I know that Blue Ray offers a better High Definition picture.  So, if I got myself conditioned to watching Hi Def films, I will then see the reduced quality of all my regular DVD's, and I don't want that to happen.  I'm at a level of tolerance that allows me to enjoy all my regular DVD's.  Blue Ray would just start me on a journey of frustration because I have so many good movies on DVD, and I do not want to buy them again.  Even renting Blue Ray will open the door to hindering my appreciation of my own standard DVD's.  Ignorance is bliss for me.  Blissful, and affordable, because I am done buying movies.  I can put my money towards better things these days.  So, you people just keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.  It's only money.
i was never a big fan of the terminator films<br />this one was differnt,i really liked its gritty sets etc. its well worth seeing!<br />check it out!
I just watched a screener of the director's cut, which is only 2-3 minutes more in running time than the theatrical version.  Let me first say that I thought this movie was solid from an action standpoint.  However, the myriad of plot holes, cheesy lines and bad acting moments from the theatrical version are still present in this Director's Cut!  Most of all, the infamous Moon Bloodgood topless scene is here....and it is TERRIBLE!! Description:  It's a short scene right before her character, Blair and Marcus get ambushed by thugs in the night.  For some reason, Blair walks out in the middle of the pouring rain and removes her top to wash her chest.  She covers her breasts with her hands, turns around at Marcus.  They give each other a long yearning stare...End Scene. I assume that McG was trying to force some kind of sexual tension between the two characters. Or maybe she was testing Marcus to see if she could trust him.  But why test him and have her gun more than 50 yards away for the thugs to find??  In short, the scene served absolutely no purpose in movie whatsoever and guess what, it didn't even show "them".  Poorly executed on every level and just embarrassing to watch!!<br /><br />But the biggest problem I had with the plot is the belief that Connor had to save Kyle Reese.  This posed so many problems! The first 3 Terminator movies were about protecting the young John Connor to ensure the future.  But in Salvation, John Connor has to protect the young Kyle Reese to ensure the past, present AND future.  Clever writing, but still flawed because the movie basically takes the "Back to the Future" approach to time travel.  The belief that if Kyle Reese dies in the Resistance, then he can't go back in time.  Therefore, John Connor won't exist.  So does Connor actually believe that he could disappear out of thin air like in "Back to the Future"???  What's even more perplexing is that John Connor is the hero, the prophet and the messiah in the movie. However, when he makes his big speech on the radio commanding the Resistance to stand down from bombing Skynet, his speech is very AMBIGUOUS.  As the viewer, you don't know if Connor intends to save the human prisoners in Skynet or just save Kyle Reese. In the previous Terminator films, it was justifiable for Sarah Connor and other characters to protect the life of John Connor.  But in Salvation, Connor protecting his own existence is theologically flawed.  Bottom line, is it okay for "the messiah" to save himself so he can be the savior of humanity in the future??  In my opinion, that is just sloppy and misguided story-telling!!<br /><br />Other plot holes. 1) No explanation on why Kyle Reese was number 1 on the Skynet kill list. 2) When Reese was identified, why didn't Skynet kill him immediately? 3)Once Marcus entered the Resistance compound, why didn't Skynet just locate him and invade? 4) Worst of all, the heart of the film was literally a heart in the film!!!<br /><br />I was hoping that the Director's Cut would address some of these plot holes, but it addressed NONE of them.  Unfortunately, McG seemed more preoccupied with cool, flashy one-take action sequences than story-telling. Rumor has it that there will be a FINAL CUT released after this Director's Cut.  Unless there were actual re-shoots, I highly doubt any of these problems will be fixed. Overall, the blame ultimately lies on the director McG. It was a good effort though.
This movie was really good.  Confused how so many did not give it a good rating on Yahoo and other sites.  I am impressed.
Boy, this got hammered by most critics. But I don't know what the problem was - I know it's pretty grim from start of finish, and it doesn't have the humor of the earlier Terminator flicks. But I thought this was really well done, and that both Christian Bale and especially Sam Worthington did a fine job, the story moved along quickly for a 2-hour movie, and there were enough twists and turns to keep me interested throughout. Besides, how can you not love a movie who's leading babe is named Moon Bloodgood (REAL name, not her character!)I think it was unfairly maligned because of the high budget and Bale's on-set rant; but taken as a straight sci-fi action movie, it's pretty darn good!
Didn't even know about this addition to the series until I was looking at them on Amazon.  Will enjoy watching it with the rest of the series
WARNING SPOILERS!!! What was the point of the movie? That's the question I kept asking myself after the movie. What was the point of the movie besides making money and gearing up for the obvious sequel a few years down the road.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation in my opinion is by far the worst terminator movie mainly because there is no point to the movie. No big secrets are revealed nothing new was done that hasn't been done before and better, and the story went no where except to make money and to get ready for more movies down the road.<br /><br />The only actors that had any impact were Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood. They were the only two that felt alive during this movie. Christian Bale did a terrible job, and he's a good actor two. Which reflects badly on the director McG. After all he did direct the two bad Charlie's Angles movies.<br /><br />The only real good thing about this movie were the special effects, but if that's the best thing you can say about a movie that isn't animated than that's not saying much.<br /><br />Overall: A real disappointment, just skip it and wait for it to come out on DVD and rent it.
The digital copy included in the set expired in April 2010.  I just purchased it for the holidays.  I would not have purchased this set if I had known.  Now that it's open it can't be returned.
Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent.  The item description above says it is 2.40:1, but before I read that, I thought it was 2.35:1.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent - lot's of surround sounds and sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />The movie lasted about 1 hour and 47 minutes.  I thought it was pretty good, except for the ending, which I thought was incomplete.
This is a really really really good movie and I was very glad to find the director's cut of it.
THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND I HAVE EVEN GIVEN IT OUT TO MY FRIENDS TO WATCH IT. CHRISTIAN BALE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE JOHN CONNOR.
My family thought that this DVD was in a very good condition. Enjoyed it very much
I thought the story behind this movie was a great idea, except for the plot behind the supporting actor but that's not a bad thing per se. My main question with it would be if Skynet could do this with one person why not make more of them? I would rate this one right up there with T2. This movie may break with the time-travel use of the first three movies but I see that as a wise choice. I don't know if there will be another Terminator movie but if it's close to the quality of this one it will be good.
I've never been a Terminator fan maybe because I'm not an Arnold fan. I like Christian Bale since he played American Psycho. Therefore, I liked this movie. Simple as that. But if you're a huge fan of the series Terminator then indulge in owning a copy of Terminator Salvation.
This is a better than average action film, but compared to earlier 3, it has little emotional pitch and the themes - of fate, heroism, and evolution - are not advanced at all - you get no idea that time lines are converging in spite of tampering with time travel devices and actions, the characters are rather set and do nothing unexpected, and Conor is, well, just kind of superhuman as the robots bounces him off walls, etc.  Still, it is fun and the images are quite good at times.  The acting is very strong with Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington.  Oddly, Conor's wife, who Danes so superlatively acted in T3, is a peripheral character in this film and poorly done.<br /><br />Interestingly, I bought this as blu-ray, and I can't say that the picture, with the exception of a few images, is more than marginally better.  There is no unmistakable, quantum improvement over dvds.<br /><br />REcommended. It is worth owning if you like to dissect the nuances of the series.  I'd give this 3.5 stars.
"Terminator: Salvation" is a worthy addition to the franchise, featuring great state-of-the-arts special effects, an engaging storyline, and strong performances.<br /><br />Speaking of the latter, Sam Worthington has the more sympathetic part of a man, ripped from his criminal and murderous past to become a heroic figure of the future.  Worthington balances "butt-kicking" with emotional vulnerability that certainly make his the more memorable character to star Christian Bale's "John Conner."<br /><br />"Star Trek's" Anton Yelchin is also surprisingly good as the young Kyle Reese, managing to downplay his native Russian accent that he purposely "overplayed" in the Trek film.<br /><br />Welcome "appearances" are made by both Linda Hamilton - in the form of a photograph and voiceover - and Arnold himself in a rather computer-generated way.
I liked it the shipping was fast the Lossless audio is the best and I am also in sales so I use demo scenes from this movie to sell home audio systems ...must have!!!
As soon as I found out they were making another Terminator I was like "oh. no! Not again!" I loved the first two movies (Classic scfi), but the third movie was less than exceptional. When I learned however, that Christian Bale would play John Connor, my attention was grabbed. Suddenly I wanted to see it. So, saw it in the theatre and not only was it good, it was great! To my additional suprise Sam Worthington (whom I had never seen before) in my opion was as good (if not better than) Christian Bale in his role as Marcus Wright. His character was so believable, you find yourself cheering him on, wanting him to survive. MCG did an excellent job with this movie! By the time the credits rolled, I was hoping MCG and Bale would team up for another go. I pre-ordered the DVD I liked it that much!
I watched this movie, expecting a better storyline. There was less story and more special effects though. To me a movie is always a let down when that happens. I won't spoil it for you by telling you anything specifically in the movie. I will say that you can watch this without seeing any of the other terminator movies or The Sarah Connor Chronicles series and you will be able to follow with no problem. All in all I gave it 3 stars. Then again my views might also have been affected by my physical condition while watching the movie, as I have recently injured my back, and been laid up for over a week. Anyway, the movie is a great form of escapism, the action is almost non-stop as is the case with most terminator movies. I just wish there had been more to the storyline. It felt too gappy.<br /><br />Rod
I guess I expected more from this movie after all the terminator series I've watched.  I just wasn't that impressed with it.  As always though there was great service from Amazon.
Great movie, great price. I really like the movie, I went to see it in theatres and then bought this one. The video quality is amazing and the movie is awesome. No regrets.
Why do films that come out within 5 years of each other over use the in now hit actor? I would have prefered a no name actor to play John Conner.  The first time watching the movie I almost expected him to say I am Batman and throw a batarang or something. but other than this it is a great flick and follows well with the terminator line.
This really is a good movie. Good action. Good acting. and above all it's a good-dang Terminator movie I am not looking for Academy Award stuff here. I just want a movie that has explosions and robots. Does the movie have to have a good script? No, the thing that makes the old movies so good is the ridiculous script. I want people to stop whining that this movie sucked because if you compare it to the old films, without letting your biased for the "classics" get in your way, then this movie is actually better then the first two. The third one was really just a mistake and I will acknowledge that at least.<br /><br />So if you want a good action movie with a decent story, and quite convoluted at times if you think about it,then watch this one.<br /><br />PS think about the title of this review also while you watch.
Way to many people are trashing this movie for no good reason. This is a fine addition to the Terminator storyline. Set in the future after "Judgment Day" it follows John Connor leading the resistance. The movie is well written and well acted (Worthington has serious potential) and throws you the occassional curveball to keep you interested. The action is well done and cgi compliments it! A must see for anyone who is a fan of the franchise. If this is your first exposure to it, you will find yourself looking for the other three movies a.s.a.p.<br /><br />MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful print with some eye popping sequences. Demo Disc potential. FINAL VERDICT: A MUST OWN.
Terminator is like one of those franchises where if there's enough rumors and speculation about a potential sequel in the future, you can bet some screenwriter or producer is like "hey yeah! we can make a new..." and find someone with the interest in doing it. I mean Terminator 1 and 2 are considered, T2 especially, to be classics so any director would most likely snap at the chance in doing another installment even if the fanbase or the story doesn't need it and so we have Terminator Salvation, a film directed by McG who's predominantly known for directing Charlie's Angels on the big screen. So how's the film? It's strangely not...bad? Well I shouldn't say that as there's clear problems with the film right from the get-go whether it's script-related or just the direction in the film,there's so many off elements that it feels like the good stuff has to battle it out with the bad stuff just to save face. It's not an utter travesty like many claimed but the movie just does so much wrong that it's like doing a guitar solo and for every awesome moment, there's just dead notes.<br /><br />The year is 2018 (a year shown in red against a black background which made it strangely hard to read for me) and Judgement Day has happened leaving mankind to fight to survive not only in terms of supplies and shelter but in their war against the machines developed by Skynet. Found wandering the wasteland is Marcus Wright, a former death row inmate now walking a world he's unfamiliar with and with company he's just met, namely Kyle Reese and small mute girl Star. Also in the former world fighting the machines is John Connor, who some believe to be the savior for humanity while others believe he's just nutty (though we strangely don't get that side of the conflict in the movie much). Marcus and John will eventually meet and form an unlikely partnership as they try to take down Skynet.<br /><br />My problems with the story strangely can be best evidenced in the "Maximum Movie Mode", the innovative commentary/picture-in-picture/analysis of the film you might've seen in the "Watchmen" release. Near the end of the film, McG shows us 2 deleted scenes: the first being one uninterrupted take of John Connor delivering a speech prior to the infiltration on Skynet and urging them not to attack. It's a more personal and indeed more upfront Connor and almost humanizes him more, especially when he brings up his mother Sarah, a woman thought crazy now proven to have been right all along and director just took it out. Then there's the 2nd: Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, reaches into his pocket and takes out a photo of Sarah Connor, the familiar one we all know from the end of the first film. This could've had huge symbolic weight to it. Imagine it: you literally hold your future in your hand, that being a woman you fall for, a woman you conceive a child with and a woman you die for protecting her and all this for somebody what...late teens, early 20's? Yet it's taken out. Then there's nods to the old films like the line "I'll be back", which previously brought with it impending doom (first one) or a welcome rescue hero moment (second movie)...here? It's just any old line of dialogue. They even bring back Guns N Roses "You Could Be Mine" for no other reason than to go "hey remember this from T2?" Then there's weird plot elements that are either missing (what happened to owning dogs to warn them of approaching terminators? Or was that later? Or how a gigantic-ass Transformer-sized robot can creep up on a shack in the middle of nowhere. What, was he on his tiptoes?<br /><br />So obviously you can see I don't like the story but how's the action you ask? Quite good actually...for the first bit. Metal Gear stealth robot moment aside, that whole section which culminates in a high-speed car chase on the highway is awesome and the digital effects are better than ever and with an eye that's noticed bad and good CGI over the years since Jurassic Park, this is some fine CGI,though the surprise cameo at the end is incredibly dodgy. But the film kind of loses steam after a character is imprisoned and 2 others captured and even then the action almost feels ordinary. Acting-wise it's...fine with Christian Bale still doing that "smokes 10 packs a day" voice he used for Batman or he just simply whispers while Bryce Dallas Howard is barely given anything to do, ditto for Common who we see has an arc involving a dead brother but that just disappears. One pulling the weight is Sam Worthington, now seemingly the hottest thing in sci-fi thanks to this, "Avatar" and forthcoming "Clash of the Titans" whose accent occasionally wavers but delivers on a good character arc. And boy-in-a-man's-world Anton Yelchin does a serviceable job as Kyle Reese though was oddly better as Chekov in "Star Trek".<br /><br />Ever since commentaries entered the DVD special features, many directors utilized this bonus to comment on the filmmaking process, scene inspiration or working with a certain actor. Now with Bluray, studios are enhancing it a bit further with what's called "Maximum Movie Mode", a sort of commentary hybrid that mixes picture-in-picture showcasing the filming of a certain scene compared to the final image, storyboards and concept art, interviews by the cast and crew and more prominently, a presentation done by the director that points out certain elements on screen or dissects a certain element. While it's certainly innovative and handy, it can also lead to some parts being missed entirely such as the scene where Marcus discovers the truth about himself (the part spoiled in the trailers) and instead of commenting on the concept behind the scene and the discussion it creates, McG talks about the different acting styles of the 2 and just wants the "camera to do the talking". The rest of the special features are functional though they're hardly on the same level of detail as Star Trek's bonus features was. As far as the director's cut is concerned, like another reviewer pointed out, there's some small omissions and some little moments taken out but it isn't a radical re-design of the film so don't expect the same kind of shift that tends to accompany a director's cut.<br /><br />Is Terminator Salvation worth a purchase? Yes and no though I'm sure people will lean towards a no. It has nothing as far as the humanity elements from T2 yet it's way better than Terminator 3 so this is either hopefully a stumbling block in this "reboot" if you will or we're going to suffer 2 more average-but-could-be-better entries. Either way, it's a Bluray showcase, it's a home theater showcase, just not a great movie.
BACKGROUND<br />Back in the 80s I wasn't a fan of the first Terminator movie and actually I wasn't fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies at all. Years later I gave a chance to T2 and I was blown away. I thought that the movie was awesome and that they rescued the story. But then years later T3 came out and I was very disappointed. Now with Terminator Salvation I have mixed feelings. The movie and plot is essentially good and entertaining, but now I'm convinced that T2 was "an anomaly that went strangely great".<br /><br />PLOT<br />Ok, this is a summer action packed movie, if you are looking for that, you will get it. Explosions, killer robots, lots of action, etc. As long as I remember T3, this is a very different story. On this movie, the world is at war against the machines (kind of the war described in the Matrix trilogy, so if you ever imagined a prequel to Matrix, this could have been the script).<br /><br />As any other sci-fi movie that needs to show that humans are losing the war, is set in desert locations. This adds certain texture to images and overall aspect of the film. Just to give you an idea of the looks of this movie, the first thing that comes to my mind is Mad Max, the latest is Resident Evil: Extinction (and a lot of other movies in between).<br /><br />PERSONAL COMMENT<br />I have never been a hardcore fan of Terminator series, but I found this movie really entertaining and enjoyable. Hardcore fans will always complain about anything, but if you just want to sit back and relax 2 hours, this is for you.<br /><br />CAST<br />Christian Bale is playing John Connor while Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a cameo appearance. Sam Worthington is introduced as a new character that links humans with machines. I thing that is all you need to know. The performances are solid for a sci-fi action film.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />Again the T2 drums appear. They still sound great. Generally speaking the score is good.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />This is good movie within its genre, intended for action/sci-fi followers. It's not definitive in the series but it's definitively better than T3. You will end enjoying it if you just sit back and relax.
We rented the movie (video on demand) and loved it.<br />We stopped it 45 minutes into the movie to refresh our drinks.....it felt like only 15 minutes had passed.<br />Definitely worth the rental !
Excellent movie.  Not easy to pull off the machines warfare and they did it very well.  I liked the new guy, well cast, and that Asian chick was hot.  Bale needs to remove that nasty wart on his nose.  That also should be the last Terminator.  It ended perfect.  Move along Hollywood!
BLU-RAY 3 DISC REVIEW<br /><br />"Terminator Salvation" created high hopes for the salvation of this profitable franchise for the studio as well as for fans of the original films James Cameron made. While I was initially disappointed with the film and the major gaps of logic/storytelling that dogs the film, there are a number of scenes that suggest a much better movie was steamrolled by studio interference, budget cuts and last minute rewriting. T4 had potential buried in it which makes the film all the more disappointing. Still of you set your brain on cruise control and just enjoy the ride it's a mindless diversion although hardly in the same category as T1 or T2 much less the enjoyable but inferior T3.<br /><br />SPOILERS IN MY PLOT SYNPOSIS:<br />Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington in a terrific performance that seemed destined for a better film)decides to donate his body to a Cyberdyne researcher (Helena Bonham Carter in an interesting cameo) after he is executed for murder. He wakes up not in Hell but subjected to hell on Earth in the year 2018. John Connor leads resistence fighters and discovers a weapon that they can use to destroy the machines and is given an order to test it. Wright encounters Connor's father Kyle Reese. When he's captured by Connor (Christian Bale), Marcus discovers he's a cyborg designed to trick find Reese and trick Connor. Marcus convinces Connor to reluctantly agree to partner up with him in rescuing Reese before he's killed.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and sounds pretty darn stunning.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc includes both the original theatrical cut and the first "Director's Cut" (more accurately called the "R" Rated Cut) that McG submitted when the film was to be rated "R" (Warner had McG trim 3 minutes from the film for a much more friendly PG-13 to attract more viewers). Why Warner couldn't have just had a seamless branched version of BOTH films I'm not sure. It would have been far more valuble to allow McG to integrate the 40 minutes of cut footage into the film fleshing out some of the characters. I suspect we'll see that with some sort of "ultimate" edition later down the line. There are some clever tips of the hat to the first two movies, Cameron's "Aliens" and other science fiction films. To me it appeared that this clearly was a labor of love enough if the finished film does not quite measure up.<br /><br />Also has a number of extras including the Maximum Movie Mode which allows McG to appear on screen in a visual commentary track that gives us behind-the-scenes footage, drawings and concepts for the film. We also get a number of brief featurettes that show us how the Rototerminators were created, how Arnie made his "cameo" (it's actually quite clever)and the creation of the post-apocalpytic future we see.<br /><br />A mindless bit of entertainment that fails to live up to the potential of the first two films, TS has promise but fails to deliver on it due to last minute rewrites and studio interference. Still, the film has a strong cast, a number of memorable scenes and visual effects that hint at a much better film that was terminated prior to shooting/release.
The Terminator story line is getting a little long in the tooth.  But, if you bought in from the beginning you have to see this latest edition.  It could be done so much better, but at least we see the story progress...or regress as the case may be.  Any "Terminator" fan has to see this one as well.
I went to see this movie and actually liked it. I think it would have been a little better if they could have had Arnold in it someway beside the little computer generated version of him for a couple of seconds. As far as how McG is releasing this on DVD, I am not happy. Where is the 2 disc special edition for DVD? I don't have a Blu-Ray player, and I don't plan on buying one anytime soon, but I like to get the special editions of movies on the DVD. Every other big movie this year has a 2 disc special edition on DVD, but not Terminator, WHY? I was really looking forward to the extend version that McG had talked about, and in the beginning he did say he was making a special edition for DVD, but not when release time actually came around. I guess I will have to deal with regular movie.
Let me start off by saying that I rarely write negative reviews on Amazon.  Although I don't write that many reviews here, I prefer to spend my time writing reviews about items, movies and music that I really like that I think will be helpful to others.<br /><br />That being said, this movie is so awful, I felt compelled to write about it here.  I'm a HUGE fan of the first two Terminator movies.  They both certainly rank in my top movies of all time, so I was really excited to see this latest installment.  Oh man, I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  Extremely thin storyline, no new twist, horrendous amateur acting, woeful script and a complete lack of directing skill.  Basically, they took the storyline which we all know and tried to create special effects around it and use a lot of the lines from the previous films as comedic gestures.  Incredible mistake.  Using phrases like "I'll be back" and "Come with me if you want to live", completely out of context, was excruciating and embarrasing to watch. No imagination whatsoever on the directing or writing.<br /><br />Although they had some really good actors in the film, the lack of a proficient director and a decent script gave them very little to work with and their performances ended up being very soap-opera'ish.  How Christian Bale got caught up in this mess is beyond me.  Although, I'm sure he got a decent paycheck for it.<br /><br />I hope the next installment is put in the hands of a proper director who can infuse vision, uniqueness, direction and storyline into the project. In my opinion, give this one a miss.  It will only disappoint.
Not impressed...  clearly the only motivation behind this movie was to make a buck off the popularity of the first three Terminator movies...  by 15 minutes in I was waiting for it to be over.  About the most memorable thing for me about this movie was all the growling and yelling by Christian Bale (John Connor).  Seems all he did was scream the whole time.  The twist w/ Marcus Wright and his thread through the film was semi-interesting, but not enough so to save the picture overall.  There were some intense action scenes to thrill the 11 and 12 year old boys that were watching, but beyond that I found this to be a huge letdown.
This is one of those movies where you watch half of it hoping it will get better, but it never does. As the time progresses, your hope of the filmmakers salvaging the project or building up to something really great fades away, and you're left with an ending that was obviously changed at the last minute and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie (not that the original ending could have been much better). I don't know how you can pour so much money and talent into a film like this and have this be the product. It's a stunning failure when you think about it. The special effects are great and there is a lot of action, and you can tell they even TRIED to put some depth into the story, but even these solid ingredients somehow turn bitter when thrown together the way they are in this movie. Perhaps the movie's worst offense is the dialogue. The very first scene sets the bar for the film so low that you wouldn't think it could possibly get any worse, but apparently the director loves a challenge and he found a way. By the end of the movie you won't care if all the characters die, in fact, you might even wish they did.
I agree with everyone else here.  I call this an EPIC fail!  The sad part is, I own a PS3 and STILL won't buy this in protest!  I find it very offensive that only Blu Ray customers get the Director's Cut.
I saw it thinking it was going to be so terrible. Do not listen to reviewers. They think it was terrible. I liked it better than the originals. The action was great, storyline was actually pretty good, and the acting was terrific. I only found it to be a little short because I didn't want it to stop.<br /><br />Action: 10/10<br />Storyline: 10/10<br />Length: 7/10<br />Twist at the end: 10/10<br /><br />Definite must buy.
This is the worst terminator movie. How anyone can like it is beyond me 1-3 were good this one was utter crap.
This movie was really boring. I couldn't stay up. The photography is dull. The final battle is too similar T1,T2 and Aliens and quite frankly expected more. I missed Arnold big time. The TV series is far superior.<br />I only managed to watch the directors cut and often the scenes/editing comes off as dull. Bale lacks any form of Charisma and Worthington is actually not required. Moon Bloodgood/Bryce Dallas Howard are wasted here. T3 may have had it's faults but it was far more entertaining than this, and the leads actually had better things to do. This movie reminds me of Mummy 3.
The special effects are really good.  Some of the story is good.  But overall, it seemed inconsistant with the other Terminators.  The ending was corny.
I'm a big Terminator fan. It's one of my most favorite movies of all time. I love T1 and T2. T3 was made for the fans and I loved that too just because it got Arnold back in his old role. When I heard another Terminator movie was going to come out I figured it was either going to be mind blower, or really poorly done. Terminator salvation is somewhere in between those two. It's a mind blower because they adapted a lot of new concepts into the Terminator story arc, but it's poorly done because it doesn't follow the originals too well.<br /><br /> T-Salvation is a "Super" Holly Woodized version of T1 & T2. With all the special effects added in, it kind of took away from the realism of Terminator and made it seem a bit too "Sci-Fi" or just unbelievable. It lacked the element of realism that made T1 & T2 so fantastic. Watching Terminator Salvation made me flashback to watching "War Of The Worlds" or "Transformers" with it's heavy CGI use. It's just action scene after action seen with a shallow story in between.<br /><br /> Aside from the usual focus on John Conner this one mainly centered around Kyle Reese and an unknown Terminator Marcus Wright. I enjoyed the Unknown Terminator more than anyone else in this film. He was the only one that had a "personality" and "story" to add to the film.<br /><br /> The weirdest thing about it all is that it seemed to take John forever to trust and accept the Unknown Terminator as an ally...I only guess he forgot about the last to films T2 and T3 where a Terminator only SAVED HIS LIFE! about a dozen times. I mean common what is this garbage! Did the writers not ever see any of the other films? In this movie John hates Terminators more than they hate themselves. You think after all these years he would realize that the Terminators can be programmed to protect people instead of just killing them... or did he forget what he learned from Arnold?<br /><br /> The bottom line is that what  makes this movie such a disappointment is its lack of a developed story, and knowing the series they could have done so much better. It's the future and John is the leader of a "resistance group" and people follow him on command. I must have fell asleep between T3 and Terminator Salvations because I think there's a movie missing. You know the one they made that explains HOW John became the military leader people would follow? How these massive armies came together to fight the machines, and how the machines organized and developed themselves to be such a powerful and dominating force. Terminator Salvation skips all of that and jumps right into the future. The biggest problem there is that the Machines are more advanced than the ones than we encountered in the first 2 movies that were supposed to be from a much more distant future than the one presented in T-Salvation. That's where the story becomes confusing for the audience. It's more futuristic and developed than the T1 and T3 future, but its set further back in the time than those dates.<br /><br /> When you watch Terminator Unknown throughout the movie, you realize that he is out of place, because he more humanistic than the other terminators. This is something that the T-800, and T-1000 who were created at much later dates could not achieve. Apparently Skynet was able to make a highly advanced Terminator that modeled humans perfectly, so much so that it had no problems reaching either of their primary targets "Kyle Reese" and "John Connor" that they spent the first 1-3 movies trying to kill. Even though those terminators where made at a date much later than Terminator Unknown...? That just doesn't make any sense. All it shows me is that the creators of this movie are not followers of the Terminator series. T-Salvation is completely out of place and is pretty much the "Batman & Robin"of the series (yeah the one with George Clooney).<br /><br /> Watching this film you'll appreciate the action sequences, but if your looking for those nostalgic moments that made T-1 and T-2 famous it's not here at all. Pick it up because you want to see a Terminator action film, but don't take it to heart as it has many flaws. For this reviewer the Glass was half empty. Decent film, just not as developed as it should have been and there's no excuse for that. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.
Im am a huge Terminator fan, and have seen all the movies more than twice, and I have to say this is the BEST of the whole series!!! The movie is action packed and has a sloid plot, with many twists and turns, that leave you guessing throughout the whole movie. Christian Bale And Sam Worthington in my opinion both played an excillent role in the movie. I won't really tell the plot for those of you who have never seen it, but all i'll say is that it takes place a few years after Terminator 3, and Skynet has terminated half of the human race, now creating different types, and models of Terminators to destroy those who survived the deadly attack, now called the Resistance. Buit when Skynet produces it's deadlyest Terminator model yet, the fate of the world is again in the hands of John Connor, and a few freinds, oh and lets just say...lol....Arnold's Back. 5/5!
As a James Cameron, Terminator and Christian Bale fan, I am disappointed with McG's mediocre treatment of Terminator Salvation. While the action sequences are solid and well-delivered, they do not make up for paper-thin character development and flawed story flow. The problem is that, with the exception of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), we simply don't care about any of the characters or the fate of the Resistance. McG hasn't given us much to invest in emotionally and they're little more than minigun fodder. Not having much to work with, the normally excellent Bale is wasted here. This is the shallowest John Connor by far in the series, never being more than a gun-toting, one-dimensional "blunt instrument" of military force, to quote M from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DSNF8C">Casino Royale</a>. There are bits and pieces from previous Terminator movies sprinkled in here, along with other movies like Mad Max, War of the Worlds, and even some elements that resemble the Matrix's post-apocalyptic world, especially the mech designs. It's still entertaining, but Terminator fans could totally dismiss this version and go on with their lives. This is a superfluous summer blockbuster that brings nothing new to the Terminator franchise.<br /><br />The "Director's Cut" isn't much of a director's cut. It only adds 3 minutes of brief Bloodgood boobage and more violence from the ensuing fight, not the 30-40 minutes of deleted scenes that McG has told fans in interviews would be included. The theatrical version is 115 min, the director's cut: a disappointing 118.<br /><br />The story begins in 2003 with the scheduled execution of Marcus, a death-row inmate responsible for the deaths of his brother and two cops, but I had a hard time accepting the charismatic, handsome, contemplative, and remorseful Marcus as a killer. We don't know anything about his background or crime, except the feeling that he didn't intentionally kill these men and doesn't deserve to die. At the insistence of a freakishly bald and chemo'd Cyberdyne researcher, Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), he donates his body to science. As Marcus receives his lethal injection, the scene blurs out to a text crawl about Skynet's awareness and the extermination of most of the human race on Judgment Day. Then film cuts right to 2018, to the middle of an assault on a Skynet research facility by Connor and his men. From there, it's one shoot-out or car chase after another, with little in the way of character development.<br /><br />I get that the main storyline is about second chances and what it means to be human, but these two threads are clumsily handled. McG doesn't seem to know if this is the story of John, Marcus, or Kyle and Star. In here is the cliched perceptive child mute, akin to Newt's character from Aliens, and a stereotypically callous general (Michael Ironside looking a bit like Jack Nicholson) who cared about victory over all else, even at the cost of hundreds of innocent lives. Some "WTF moments" came with the mech designs, such as the towering Terminator/people harvesters (like War of the Wolds meets Matrix mechs), the robotic serpent Hydrobots, and Moto-Terminators (gun-mounted black chaser motorcycles) launched from the legs of the giant mech. Their art direction felt wrong in the Terminator post-apocalyptic universe, and really out of place, which has up until now, been mostly a 1-on-1 engagement of single Terminator vs hero. An essential story element is missing here: the strong antagonist. This time, we get 2 heroes (with John being upstaged by Marcus), and no unstoppable new super-Terminator. I also thought that there were an awful lot of people hanging around for a desolate, war-torn future. The Terminators just aren't very good at detecting people. They need loud noises and fire to be alerted to human presence. It's not very believable for a race of sentient machines with advanced weaponry.<br /><br />As far as Terminator purists are concerned, the Terminator saga ended at 2, as James Cameron famously stated to the world. No one can replace Cameron (since he and Gale Anne Hurd created the original characters, and it was his creative vision that brought them to life), but that doesn't mean that fans of the series have to write off further efforts to extend the franchise. Though entertaining, McG adds nothing new here, and the ending is especially unsatisfying because it feels like he's taken us in a big circle. The character we care about has to die so that a character we don't care about can live. The humans may have won this battle, but the war is far from over and the ending crawl leaves the movie on a really pessimistic and circular tone, talking about fighting Skynets around the world so there's no closure or finality to the story. You can bet there will be a sequel.<br /><br />In summary, this is an fun, action-oriented blast-fest with lots of nice CG and thrilling sequences, but very short on strong characters (except for Marcus). Terminator fans and action film enthusiasts will still enjoy it a lot. Just leave your brain at the door.
This disappointing mega-music video version of Mad Max is one long romp through ruins.<br />Confusing and disjointed, frequently frustratingly illogical, it comes out boring, even with all<br />the well-done CGI mayhem. Said mayhem is non-stop, becoming a mindless blur of disjointed<br />human and robot body parts flying nowhere.<br /><br />After the first two in the series, this one is even more of a disappointment, fans should see<br /> this as a continuation of T3; motivated by simply aiming to exploit the Terminator name.<br />At least Amazon had the consideration of dropping the price to $9.99. Small consolation.
Agree with other reviewers.  Warner pulled this same stunt with Trick r' Treat (only putting bonus features on the Blu disc).  I decided not to buy this dvd because of this.  There's no reason at all that the unrated version should not be available on DVD.  I understand that DVD cannot match the picture quality or sound that Blu provides, however, DVDs have always been able to support audio commentaries and bonus featurettes and to not put them on the DVD and still charge the same prices is ridiculous.  With all the firmware problems on Blu and the fact that my TV does not support HDMI (and I'm not replacing the TV until it breaks).  The more that studio pull this garbage the less likely I will ever convert to Blu.  In fact, I now hope the Blu format fails in favor of digital downloads for HD (with DVD still being available of course).  Very, very stupid Warner.
I kept waiting for the movie to get going with suspense but it never did.  What a waste of time and money.
***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />With the exception of a few interesting action scenes, and decent acting by Christian Bale, there's not much new in TERMINATOR SALVATION. The only exception is that we're fully immersed in the post-apocalyptic world and not time-traveling into the past ... which is why it got two stars from me instead of one.<br /><br />I do love Christian Bale's acting chops. He is, to me, the complete action hero. His <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">Dark Knight</a> performance cemented that. But you need more to make a good movie, and Terminator Salvation fails to give us a new (or even interesting) storyline. What's more alarming is that rumors are circulating that a Terminator 5 film is being considered. Oh boy. Perhaps it's time to lay this series to rest. I'm not saying that T5 will be bad, but if the track record for this series remains unchanged, then we won't be in for a highly successful sequel.<br /><br />If you're familiar at all with any of the other three Terminator movies, you're aware of John Connor (played here by Christian Bale), the quintessential hero against the thinking machines; machines that have brought mankind to near extinction. In T4 we stay firmly in the future, fighting the crazed machine-made mankillers (with the exception of a brief stint in the present that rapidly moves us forward) and discovering that Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, AVATAR) - a man from the past awakened in the future - has become a weapon for the machines by being an unawares accomplice in trying to eradicate the human population. When his true identity as a machine is finally revealed, it is as much a surprise to him as to the "humans." With the help of a young and feisty Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVCFK6">Star Trek</a>), Marcus fights his way through the machines and into the safety of the humans. Here we see him battle with the knowledge of his new internal, metallic identity, and throw himself into the war. But who's side is he really on? This is "The Big Question" that the audience is supposed to ponder but, to no one's surprise, the embittered and oft-conflicted anti-hero makes "The Right Choice."<br /><br />In addition to being a clich&eacute;, the movie even reinvents a scene from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a> in which a Terminator gets frozen and tries to break free. Been there. Done that. Let's move on people!<br /><br />The final word I have on this film is that it really doesn't do what it should, which is to show us a great story about characters we've come to know through cinema. But instead, we got a rehashing of old themes with a bit of action eye-candy. Not much to it, really.
this is a great movie, of course it is not a james cameron movie, it is not supposed to be!!! but it was so much more entertaining than the other terminators. we loved it, promise you will not be dissapointed, cool action futuristic movie!!
AWESOME addition to the series :D  Saw the film 4 times in the theater!!
this movie is the best ever seen. we been waiting a long time for this particular moment. and now its here.
product was in excellent condition. shop with confidence.<br />would buy from this seller again.
Blu Ray is the only way to watch this movie...excellent sound with surround sound setup and the picture is extra crisp.
MY FAMILY AND I LOVED THIS MOVIE.<br />IT WAS THE BEST ONE YET..FULL OF ACTION AND ENTERTAINMENT..<br />TWO THUMBS UP..
I fell asleep after about of hour of watching this movie....it was ok i guess looked great on blu-ray but as far as the movie goes....nowhere near as good as the other 3 terminator movies
just wanted to let everyone know that target is selling the directors cut on dvd. i think it's the only place you can get it.
Please, James Cameron, buy back the rights to Terminator (I hear Halcyon could use the money) and save us all from a continuing slew of mediocre "sequels" and a poorly executed, woefully under-budgeted, and ultimately canceled TV show (T3, this film, and TSCC).<br /><br />The only good that's come out of the never ending milking of the franchise is the intriguing protector Terminator character of Cameron Phillips (portrayed by Summer Glau) from TV's The Sarah Connor Chronicles, who is smitten with one baffled and equally smitten John Connor (star-crossed lovers, anyone?).  That's it... end of story.<br /><br />Don't get me started on Christian Bale's one-note embodiment of an older John Connor, or the cringe-worthy effort by Nick Stahl in T3, or the equally flat performance of Kristanna Loken as the TX, or the bland Marcus Wright hybrid played by Sam "I look bored with my job" Worthington in Salvation.<br /><br />If James Cameron or someone of equal vision and skill could make an entertaining, intelligent, and timely sci-fi/action/adventure epic around a 20-something Cameron (again played by Summer) and a 20-something John Connor and make it an official T3 (ignoring Rise of the Machines and Salvation completely) I'd give this theoretical sequel a chance.  Heck, I'd even love Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick and even Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn to come back for more fun (you have time travel and alternate time lines, JD being pushed back even farther into the future, and a non-Cyberdyne Skynet-like entity evolving differently this time around, at your disposal, so anything is possible... even if the original cast is showing its age-- like us all).  Get the band back together!<br /><br />Until then... stick with watching the classics The Terminator and T2: The Extended Cut.  Don't waste your time or your money on this flick.
If all you care about in a movie is one action sequence after another, hardly any dialog, zero character development, and no story.... this is defiantly the movie for you. This movie makes T3 look like a classic and the TV show Emmy worthy.
This is not acceptable. Why am I not in this movie. You cannot self terminate, but you will all be terminated.
see it finished a few minutes ago, the action secuences are just great, the argument that connects this with the other three films is superb, the sarah connor picture, the records, Kyle Reese, and of course Arnold, Sam Worthington in deed is worth to watch as the human hybrid-terminator(he rocks here much more than Avatar) , however, hardly a heart transplant can take place in a tent, further that the surgery is performed by a veterinary!!!....mmmm talking nonsense... i give it 4 or 5 stars, nevertheless is a very good movie!
The movie was great and all, but what happened to the extras (Deleted Scenes, Bloopers, Gag Reel and other extras)?  This was a bare bones release.  If they are going to release a movie to DVD, they should have all the extras that the fans would like to have.  What's the deal on the digital copy?  Why should I have to log onto the Web to get my digital copy.  I paid for a 2-Disc set, do I expect to have a DVD of the movie and a Digital Disc copy of the movie, not a coupon to download the digital copy.  Let's see that's fraud in my opinion or disceptive practices.  Wonder what the FCC would think about this?
Gads! All the whining!<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" did what it was supposed to do. ENTERTAIN! So the Blu-Ray edition had a director's cut, so the DVD didn't have extras. So all the folk who saw it at the theaters were stupid?<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" is first and foremost, a Sci-Fi film (which means that it most likely will play fast and loose with things like physics, technical jargon, weapons with an unlimited supply of ammunition, among others. All three of the previous films of the franchise did the same thing (but it didn't stop any of the grousers from seeing it, anyway).<br /><br />The story is only a snippet of the story of John Connor, meaning the franchise has a looooong way to go yet. I happen to like the "new" terminators (and there were a bunch!) introduced, and the pace was lightning quick, meaning I had to watch certain segments over, to get full effect. Yes, the acting was two-dimensional at times, but this is a Sci-Fi/Action film, and considering Schwartzeneggar's portrayals in the first three films, not unexpected. Still, the film doesn't suffer because of this. The story is still engrossing for those devotees of the franchise.<br /><br />It's funny that with the exception of Christian Bale, the better known actors like Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander were relegated to what were essentially bit parts. It's sad, too, because Jane Alexander is such a wonderful actress! The rest are relative unknowns, with maybe Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog) and Bryce Dallas Howard being notable exceptions. Still, the performances were good.<br /><br />I won't go into specific details of the story, as there are many here who just had to jump on their computer to get their reviews in FAST, so as to lay it bare, thinking they were doing us all a favor. Suffice to say, "Terminator:Salvation" is as good a Sci-Fi/Action film as you are likely to see, until maybe...."Avatar".
Not really. That quote was a part of Christian Bale's infamous meltdown/tirade recorded on the set of this film (Hear it on youtube). After watching the extended director's cut of this film, I can now understand and sympathize with Mr. Bale's tension on the set...he obviously came to the realization that this was not one of his better career choices and became crankier as the project wore on.<br /><br />This film only passes because it's a part of a much broader canvas in the franchise. You can find moments to like in the film because you like the Terminator films you grew up with or you like specific actors in the project. Sam Worthington singlehandedly saves this film from being a total failure.<br /><br />Pro: For any fan of the previous T films, we finally get to see a storyline that takes place in the "future" post judgment day.<br /><br />Con: We have to sit thru a poorly thought out T film storyline in the hands of a hack director that wants to only be known to the world as "McG". Whenever you see McG in a film's credits, you know can't be good and expectations need to be tempered WAY down.<br /><br />Pro: In a post-apocalyptic wasteland where everyone is dirty, Bryce Dallas Howard manages to get a hold of amazing makeup to keep her looking fresh, glossy and ready for WAR!<br /><br />Con: For a future full of Terminator machines running the planet, we sure don't get to see them very often and if we do it's only one moving special effect robot at a time. During a fight in a Terminator killbot FACTORY we only see ONE working Terminator taking on our heroes.<br /><br />Con: So very many plot holes in this bad script.<br /><br />Con: Did I mention McG? Director's cut does not mean a better film...it means more bad choices by this guy.<br /><br />This is a rental at best because you will forget about it as soon as you get over how much you paid for it when the story ends.
I was expecting great things after Christian Bales apparent lack of enthusiasm for T3. Unfortunately for him Terminator 3 Rise of The Machines is far superior to Salvation on every level, better storyline, characters, and much better climax to T4, which is really too derivative of T2's final set piece.<br /><br />The problem with T4 is that it has no real story to it that you can speak of,<br />quite frankly it's a mess. Sam Worthington is totally miscast, and seems bored<br />throughout the whole movie. As for Christian Bale it's a case of now you see him, now you don't.<br /><br />On the plus side it is full of special effects that fans will love. Ironically the gas station sequence and the subsequent chase scene following it, is the movie's saving grace. It's truly superb and is one of the best set pieces I have seen in any of the Terminator movies. I have not seen the Directors Cut but I am sure it has to be better than this.
I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!
I didn't necessarily have high hopes for this film, but I didn't shun it at first sight either. It had rather strong casting, and with Christian Bale in it, I figured it could be very surprisingly good, since about every film he is in gets rather good reviews by critics, but I am afraid this one was a miss fire by Bale. Throughout the movie, you can almost see it in his eyes, that he knows how horrible the movie is. By the way he communicates with everyone in the movie, you can almost hear him saying, "Why the heck am I in this film? The plot is extremely linear and boring, the script is very poorly written and is even more poorly executed by the actors, and why is my character suppose to be such a wimp? I'm John Connor! I am suppose to be the last bad-A left in this God-forsaken war, yet I act like I am a pre-pubescent teenager!" I believe these realizations are the cause of his notorious fiasco on the set of Terminator Salvation.
the trailer for T:salvation was perhaps one of the better trailers I'd seen in  along time. Despite the fact that McG was directing, my expectations were high. But man was the movie disappointing. Sure the special effects were great, which is a credit to the animators and the budget for FX, but everything else was just terrible. The story was WEAK, the acting mediocre, the editing choppy and all the fun of the previous terminator movies was completely missing. It was an overserious bore.
Okay so after ordering this item I googled this company (InetVideo) that was sending it to me and I found that these guys are from Canada. I felt jipped because I thought I was ordering from New York or from the East Coast. It's been a while since I received this item so I am writing this review a bit late. All I can remember was that they took foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to ship the item, and then when I opened the package that looked like it was supposed to be for shipping animal products 'cause it said something about animal product packaging. This envelope had no bubble wrap or anything to protect my movie. The movie itself is great and I loved it but the case for the DVD is not like the Terminator 3 DVD that I purchased within the same week off Amazon. This thing is flimsy and I was extremely aggravated. Like you get what you pay for but there are items that you pay like $0.01 for and shipping is $2.98 and the product is great! Honestly stay away. Go get the DVD from another company because InetVideo SUCKS! I don't like writing bad reviews but these guys deserved it. I spent $7.81 and got the movie late, risked the possibility of damage to the DVD due to the carelessness of the company to package it with consideration and I have to go buy a new DVD case because it's weak and I don't want anything to happen to the DVD. Seriously, go spend your $7.00 on a burger from In and Out or something. Don't give them your money.
Totally unorginal film!  Don't bother with this tripe, I would write more but is impossible to make this movie any worse than it is!!!!!
I WAS REALLY UPSET THAT THE LATEST DVD RELEASE OF TERMINATOR SALVATION DID'NT HAVE THE BONUS FEATURES ON IT. I DON'T LIKE FACT THAT THE DVD SALES MARKETING IS SHOVING BLUE RAY DVDs AND THAT OBNOXIOUS SECOND DISC OF DIGITAL COPIES DOWN OUR THROATS. WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PAY EXTRA FOR A DIGITAL COPY DISC IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO USE THE DVD MOVIE ONLY?<br /><br />I ALWAYS BUY DVD WITH BONUS FEATURES BECAUSE IT GOES OVER HOW THE MOVIE WAS MADE AND INTERVIEW WITH THE ACTORS AND OTHER MOVIE EXTRAS.<br />THE DVD SALES MARKETERS ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF THEY START AND CONTINUE TO DO THIS.<br /><br />AS FAR AS THE MOVIE IS CONCERNED IT WAS GIVEN A 3 STAR RATING BY ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A LITTLE BETTER. THE ACTION SCENES WERE TO A MINIMUM AND IT DRAGGED AT TIMES. I'M A BIG TERMINATOR FRANCHISE FAN SINCE ITS FIRST RELEASE IN 1985. I JUST THOUGHT IT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER.
This movie sucks! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the great special effects. Extremely bad acting, HELLO......Christian Bale, need I say more? Extremely stupid ending too! My God, who approved this script? They should be castrated!And who ever thought Bale would be good as John Connor? He sucks in everything else, but I had high hopes for this movie and just like everything else with him in it, it blows. If you just have to see it to complete the series, rent it from red box so you only waste a buck. If you suffer from insomnia, it is better for you than sleeping pills.
I stopped reading the reviews after a while as I was getting tennis neck.  I remember the same reactions to T3 - the purists hated it and the non-fans didn't get it.<br /><br />This is a popcorn movie.  Check your brain at the door.  It doesn't make good use of the Terminator franchise for sure but complaining about what could have been is pointless.  If you are a sci-fi or T fan this is a worthy bookend just for the visuals.  If you are not very familiar with the T franchise this movie tries to stand on its own with a little narration.  Ironically this movie doesn't actually advance the Terminator mythology at all since it tries too much to stand by itself.<br /><br />In all cases I think there is something for everyone as long as you remember: this isn't an art film.<br />Woulda coulda shoulda - doesn't matter.  It is done, this is probably the last movie since the Terminator rights are on the auction block now.  Make peace with it. I liked it for what it was - didn't hate it for what it wasn't.<br /><br />It's a glass half full thing... ;-)
If you want to watch a cartoon, buy "Snowhite and the Seven Dwarfs" or some other Disney animated feature.  Or if you want to wander through a game landscape and shoot at robot spiders and flying machines, buy the "Terminator:Salvation" game.  This DVD should be required to have a warning label (like those found on cigarettes.)  To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement.  The animation was of poor quality and the lip-synching for the two characters was non-existent.  Even the old Japanese Gozilla and Mothra flicks were done better.<br /><br />Instead of displaying the film in one episode, it was broken up into 6 episodes -- each with beginning and end titles and credits. Hey..I really enjoyed watching them over and over ad nauseum.  If the episodes were different, it might have made this thing more interesting but it was one chase scene after another with the spiders and flying machines shooting endlessly at the two human characters...and never hitting them.  It reminded me of those blackplotation flicks where the bad guys shoot at the black hero and never hit him while he shoots back and never misses the endless supply of bad guys.<br /><br />Was I disappointed? Absolutely! Why did I give it only a "One-Star" rating? Because nothing lower was available.
Terminator Salvation is an extremely beautiful action movie. We finally get an entire movie based around the future war. Not only do we get to see the classic terminators, but we get a ton of fascinating new implements of Skynet. Watching this movie on Blu-Ray will be an amazing experience.
didn`t think, i would ever say that. this edition is a joke. in the german version you get another complete skull head from a t-600 (like in the 6-disc edition) !!! and not just a face
This film could have been really good but it seemed like have way through it they seemed to have lost the concept or direct they were headed and fell back to what was already done before. The last half of the film had to many things that were taken and repeated from the first two films, and it just seems overally tacky...such as when the terminatior used his dad's voice to find john in the steel stairway are and then we he John tried shooting the guy and loading the gun again, or with the steel and then trying to freze him all of these were taken from T2. The only thing that was orignial and creative about this film was the future termiator who was more human than ever and was the only real likable character in the whole film, which they should have just centered the movie around versus the route they ended up going.  This film was alot better than the third film in the installment of films but not by much.
I can't review this transaction because I never got the movie.  I thought that maybe things were backlogged around Christmas, but it's February...and still no movie.
This movie is way out there... Not sure where they were trying to go with this movie but, I really can't wait till Arnold is no longer playing Governator and gets back to create another actual movie and this one is redone.  I was looking to see Terminators such as Arnold, the T-1's (from the original movie,) Summer Glau, and Kristianna Loken's characters in it or at least similarities to them, there wasn't.  Only briefly there was a single scene where one of the terminators sort of favored Arnold, even then it was a piss poor similarity to his character.<br /><br />Outside of these nuances, the overall movie was good, just not a James Cameron movie and it shows.
- The special effects are not as exciting as Terminator 2.<br /><br />- There's no suspense in this movie. Terminator 2 is suspenseful from the beginning till the end.<br /><br />- There are a lot of actions but they're not engaging as those of Terminator 2 either.<br /><br />- It was supposed to be touching at the end when someone scarified to give his heart to another person but I was not moved. I don't know it's because of bad directing or acting. It might be both.
Got this DVD some time ago from Amazon but wasn't able to review it until now.<br /><br />The director's cut is not much different then the regular version but the extras are very nice additions. I'd reccomend this to anyone who liked the film but have not bought the DVD.
This is by far the weakest Terminator movie mainly because it is just sloppy and careless. The kids (young Kyle Reese and the young black girl) are the best part of the movie. We are somehow supposed to believe that the machines would build a perfect human based cyborg without some override or control mechanism. We are also supposed to believe that John Connor and the resistance are stupid enough to use the cyborg's heart to save Connor when the cyborg is the perfect mechanism for infiltrating the machines and the only one who can actually fight them. We also are supposed to believe that the humans still are using guns against the machines that cannot damage them. Also why is it that in the obligatory final fight scene that there is only one machine participating when there are thousands of them handy? Then why is it that the machines always toss around our hero instead of just dispatching him? Lastly, why was it necessary to lure Connor to Skynet and to capture Reese in order to kill them when the spiffy cyborg could have easily killed both? I think one notable politician said that you had to "suspend disbelief". Of course that makes no sense, rather Terminator Salvation invites you to suspend belief. Maybe I will read the book by Alan Dean Foster. Its got to be better than this mess.
I am a huge Terminator fan, and have watched the previous installments in the series countless times. A huge appeal of the franchise is the in the innovative and sometimes groundbreaking special effects. On that account, this latest Terminator movie does not disappoint. The final battle between the machines and humans was previously only hinted at, as presumably the sheer scale of the special effects that would need to be used to do it full justice would have been staggering, and to do it convincingly was probably beyond technical skills until now. And yet, this great strength of this movie is also its greatest weakness. As almost everything about the future that that was feared in previous movies has come to pass, very little is left to imagination.<br /><br />Another big weakness is the storyline. What made Terminator movies so gripping and exciting to watch were the very tight and constrained narratives. Almost every action of the protagonists was well motivated and within the universe of the movie almost inevitable. "Terminator: Salvation" on the other hand is rather trite action flick, undistinguished by any special considerations. It is a rather unremarkable and undistinguished member of the action sci-fi family. It is very hard to get behind the characters and to empathize with them. The final outcome is never really in question, nor do we really care about what happens.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent action movie, but a very disappointing sequel to the Terminator franchise. Hopefully we won't have to suffer through another installment like this one. Now that Arnie has moved on with his career, it is time to terminate this series.
Not saying anything egative about the film itself, however it makes me mad when the public is duped into thinking that the "theatrical" version of the movie is the only cut of the movie that will be released on dvd and if you want the rest of the extras you have to buy it on blu ray. That is false advertising in my humble opinion.
Some spoilers follow...<br /><br />I really expected a bad movie considering it was "Charlie's Angels" McG at the helm, but it actually had the same "B" movie feeling the other three had...he could use a little help in the story editing department (the flow was a little clunky here and there...almost like stuff was missing), but the script seemed solid enough to me. Like most movies these days, I'm sure there is a great deal of footage on the floor so to speak, that could end up being an extended version of this that could possibly clarify things a bit.<br /><br />The production was outstanding...this will a great demo disc on BR, especially with the sound design...very layered and intense. The special effects were great and everything from sets to make-up to costumes and photography was a step up from the earlier films, giving it an epic feel. It has a gritty look to the action that suits the setting and story perfectly. The physical action were really well done...again, adding an intense realism to the movie without being over the top.  Stand-outs include the sensational "Harvester" chase scene and both times Conner is in a chopper...watch out!<br /><br />Another surprise here is the choice of Danny Elfman, and his score sounds quite good...a little too reminiscent of his work on Marky Mark's Ape flick maybe, but it still works none the less....he gives the music a more traditional orchestral sound opposed to the over-use of synthesizers that many action films rely on these days. It was cool to hear Fidel's main motif pop in once in a while at just the right times. There's an interesting recurring motif for the Marcus character that reminds me of Ron Grainer's work on "The Omega Man", further adding to that cool `70's apocalyptic vibe that parts of this movie has.<br /><br />Now the cast...as mentioned by many other reviews, this is definitely Sam Worthington's show...the story invests a lot of time in Marcus' journey through the film an it helps that Worthington does a really good job with his physical performance (especially with those little nods to Arnold's "stillness" along the way) and he comes across well acting-wise too. I found his struggle with what he really was provided the most poignant moments in the movie...a man trapped in a new existence as a Terminator, fighting to stay connected with his flawed humanity and looking for some kind of redemption for his own past and ending up providing a "salvation" for the resistance and it's new leader....cool stuff and an interesting twist on the whole "Terminator" story.<br /><br />Bale was almost a supporting actor in this thing...he was competent, but not outstanding. Again, his role could have been sabotaged by the script and the editing as much as anything... Compared to Marcus, Bale's John Conner seemed a little one-note with his performance throughout the film. Could be considered the nature of his character here but... There were some cool moments with him though, like when he pops on that GnR tune before capturing the MotoTerminator that brought back memories of the Connor character's motorbike stunts in T2. I also liked that it was pretty clear that not everyone in the resistance (most notably the higher-ups) though he was "all that", but the grunts in the trenches did...gave him an everyman appeal that was pretty cool.<br /><br />Another show-stealer was Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese...this young man is proving to be quite the chameleon as an actor this summer, first in "Star Trek" as the precocious boy-genius Chekov and now here he is almost literally channeling Michael Biehn (right down to talking through clenched teeth) as the young resistance fighter Reese.<br /><br />Both of the female characters are a little short-shifted here, but both Howard and Bloodgood do a good job in the brief scenes they have.<br /><br />Like the recent "Star Trek" picture, this one had a lot of visual nods (and some obvious lines) to the earlier films, from the cool opening credits looking similar to the ones the first film to a lot of physical gags from other movies as well, especially with Marcus. The action sequences were well-staged and packed some punch. And yes, the Arnold cameo featured some excellent work from ILM...very well integrated both visually and in the story....very cool. The ending? Well, I'll just leave it at...I like what the film presented way better than the "leaked" one....yeah, maybe it seemed a little sappy to some, but I though it fit well.<br /><br />The main thing that really shines though in this movie for me is that it really looks like an effort by folks that really cared about the Terminator saga and wanted to do a great job. As with any of these "franchise" movies, there are always fans who disagree with the approach taken with the film or story elements or casting choices or whatever. But it works great for me...I hope this movie finds a big, receptive audience on DVD and Blu-Ray...<br /><br />But...if this ends up being the end of the line for the Terminator saga (and the slowing domestic BO suggests it might be)...it's a good one, but I'm game for more...
They have the exclusive right to sell the 2 disc Director's Cut.  Go over to Target and buy it while you can.
I just don't get the negative reviews. I refused to watch it because of the many bad reviews. I finally decided to watch it last night. I was expecting a lousy flick. What a pleasant surprise. This movie is great. Almost as good as the first Terminator but definately better than parts two and three. If you don't like this movie you just can't appreciate originality and great action. 10 STARS OUT OF 10!
Already had a DVD of this movie...bought the Blu ray for the improved video quality.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The video quality on this Blu ray is excellent and consistent throughout the movie (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV).<br /><br />Highly recommend if you are looking for improved video quality.
I have been hooked on the Terminator series since the 1st and this one did not disappoint at all.  Special effects and the acting were excellent!  Christain Bale never lets me down - he has become one of my favorite actors ever since American Psycho.
I wasn't blown away by this installment of the Terminator series, but there was a lot to enjoy from the dirty visuals to the clever use of the original terminator body etc.<br /><br />The Director's cut however was COMPLETELY unnecessary to release. It's only about 3 mins longer which is made up (from what I noticed) of a couple partial nudity shots in the early middle of the film and a fleeting redundant mention of Conner's mom in a speech he gives over a radio towards the end which I think was added in this version. Really not worth seeing at all. Adds nothing but a small additional length. It did make me laugh though - the conversation that may have lead to re-incorporating the topless bit for the director's cut:<br /><br />Producer: "Why are we re-adding this topless shot again?"<br />Director: "DUDE - the audience just isn't going to buy that she'd want to save him later in the film unless we add this back in. When they see it, they'll react like, 'Wait a second! What's going on? Why is she saving him? He hasn't even seen her topless yet!!!'"<br />Producer: "Uh huh..."
the plot is one of THE worst ever. this is more of a side story, not a direct sequel. not how I thought the series was going to continue at all.<br /><br />also instead of making things flow smoothly continuity-wise ,they just take bits and pieces from the original and its sequel and threw them in here. you'll catch them if you're a fan.. cringe worthy stuff.<br /><br />I thought I was FINALLY going to see John running in the dark fighting TONS of Terminators, like those flashbacks have shown us,but NO. There were maybe like 10 Terminator bots in the whole movie. and not even at the same time.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on that new Terminator kid. How did he survive a NUKE blast? he came out of that whole in mint condition. that whole heart exchange thing..... RIDICULOUS !!! haha. why was that female pilot so dumb?<br />she swore to fight Terminators but she fell in love with this one in 5 minutes.<br />how can they give Bale such little screen time??? they never heard of Dark Knight?<br /><br />and the computer graphics?? SO SOOOO BAD.<br /><br />I'm so glad the movie rights are going to be sold off. hopefully another studio will wait for the right director and script. its a known fact the producers of this movie just wanted to make a quick cash with a cheesy movie. and it shows.<br />this movie has no soul.<br /><br />if you have time, Wiki what their plans were for their sequels. TRULY AWFUL STUFF !!!!
Boy, I was looking forward to this movie. More Terminator stuff, getting down and dirty with SkyNet, more background on Judgement Day, and Christian Bale to top it all off. Well, I just now finished watching it and am writing this while it's still fresh. Lousy acting. Sub-par special effects if you can believe that of a Terminator movie. Shallow story line. Really poor ending that essentially tries to necessitate another movie. Nothing is resolved. You get no sense of satisfaction. It's a hollow feeling right now. Not worth the rental price, all in all. Hard to believe, really. So typical lately of sci-fi movies, no matter what the budget or who the stars are. Maybe District 9 will be good. I hope so.
You put a director who doesn't know how to handle the mythology correctly and allows the primary actor to direct from behind his back. His even mentioned that there was over FORTY minutes cut from the movie!<br /><br />I find it hilarious that the "Director's Cut" only adds in a pathetic THREE minutes into the movie, what happened to the other Thirty-Seven minutes? You know why its a "R" rated release now? Inside those three minutes, you will see a actors.. wait for it... Breast!<br /><br />Instant Rate R!.....<br /><br />I didn't like it when I watched it in the theaters. Something there that seemed to nag at me when I walked out at the ending, and I certainly don't like it even more when I found out what was happening behind the scenes to bloat this movie into the 200 Million dollar turkey it turned into! James Cameron spent close to 120 million ('80s/'90s bucks!) to make T2 -which was an Rated R movie no less!- and made a summer blockbuster. Mgee-whiz dumped something equivalent and laid a rotten egg because he couldn't control an actor.<br /><br />Typical hollyweird in action.

I really like the terminator series of movies. What is wrong with the movie? The robots are way too stupid. The people are pretty stupid too.  Thats the main problem. If the director understood warfare tactics only alittle it would move made the movie the best yet.IT would be have more suspense and really more interesting. Id of liked all the people to hide and dart around. That is a major let down.<br /><br />This is suppose to be the future. The people and machines have been battling for awhile now. They should be expert in killing in each other. I would of liked the people to know where to shoot and robots not to miss. It would of been good if they had some kind of technology to trick the robots. An example, Have the people have remote control toys that drive out and fly around. The terminators can not track more then 10 objects at a time. Something clever. IT would of been so much better. It would of gave a glimpse of the future. The humans and machines merging into one.<br /><br />Its kind of stupid that the robots shoot and miss and the people are better shots. The people stupidly run away and get killed.  At this time it would just not be possible to be that stupid.<br /><br /> I can understand the use of firepower to suppress an and stop the enemy. The blind shooting and unlimited firepower of terminators is stupidity. The flying robots could afford to use alot of rounds but the humanoid terminators need to be smarter in using firepower.<br /><br />Then the stupid moments of love and girls are in love and stuff like that. That was pretty disappointing. Id liked some fun and smart alec language. This movie could of had some memorable moments. IT had plenty of opportunity for great banter.<br /><br />Seeing the movie once is enough. Polish up the movie like I say and people will say its the best yet. PLEASE LISTEN IF YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR.<br /><br />The first terminator movie is the best of the series. T2 is ok. T3 is going downhill.Terminator salvation is an improvement but does not meet the high standard of Terminator original.
I have not been ale to watch the movie. The seller clearly posted this as HD, but I was too dumb to know the difference. I have no way to play this disc but that's all on me. The seller posted it correctly. I was just to hurried and did not pay attention. Since it's my error, I never asked about returning it. I'll try to resell it or just donate it if I have too.
I bought this movie because I really like the Terminator series and wanted to see what that they have done with the storyline.  I was supremely disappointed.  While there are some good special effects, they are primarily composed of motorcycle and truck chase scenes that quickly become monotonous.  The storyline is dull and unimaginative, so much so that it's easy to stop paying attention and loose focus in the midst of one spectacular explosion after another.  It would have been nice if there was a strong story and the action sequences served to further the story, but sadly this is simply a special effects movie without a good plot.  At the end, once you realize it's finally over you're left wondering, "what just happened?"  They clearly left the door open for another Terminator movie, but this one was so bad that I have no anticipation to see the next chapter.  What a waste of money.
awesome film, better then T3 and problem was storylines but this was doing the writer strike, other then that awesome movie
Compradores do Brasil, cuidado, este blu-ray no possui legendas em portugus.<br />Beware custumers from brazil, there's no portuguese subtitles on this blu-ray.
I was told that I would get the 3-disc set and I got the 2-disc set.  I already opened and had to fight to get a correction.  The customer service was very painful and they are now sending me a new copy allegedly with all 3 discs. I do not have faith that I will get the right copy.  Their is a blog on one of the blu-ray sites that the have been sending both copies probally b/c they ran out and just want to full orders and hope people don't complain.

Hello people,<br />I suggest not buying this movie until the DVD is similar to the Blu-ray!
Simply horrible.  The acting, dialogue, directing.  Even the CGI wasn't that good.  Steaming Pile of....
I found myself watching the movie and some thing felt amiss it was an action packed movie but something just was alittle off. McG just doesnt get it right I loved the fist 3 movies yea even #3 I loved the sarah connor chronicles but this movie just wasnt terminator I walked away feeling very dissapointed
This is by far the worst Terminator Movie ever.None of the action of previous movies.No major fight scenes like in the first movie between the robots and humans Lots of talking and no action.If you liked the action in the 3rd one (a lot of people obviously did not by what I have been reading for other reviews)<br />then stay away from this one. I never fall asleep in movies but I begged for a pillow.lOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKED THIS ONE BUT ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE I got your back!!!!!
T4 isn't as good as the 1st.<br /><br />I had a movie ticket to use, & Paramount wasn't showing Star Trek that night.<br />It was OK.<br /><br />I rate it Z4, as in ZZZZ.
I ordered this movie about 10 days before Christmas as a Christmas present and it never arrived.  I'm still waiting for some kind of word, even from Amazon.  Still nothing even after contacting twice via email. I'm surprised Amazon even lets this kind company on their web site. Isn't collecting money under false pretenses illegal?  Thanks Amazon.
I won't add any spoilers here for those of you who don't know how the movie ends. I liked the movie... until the end. What happened at the end was so cheesy that it ruined the movie for me. Surely they could have come up with a better ending than that.
How about getting James Cameron and Christian Bale together for a remake of The Terminator and burn the rest of the Terminator history. We can ask for a bad version with McG and Schwarz. The two respective groups fit perfectly together.
For me this was the least liked Terminator movie,, I even liked 3 better.<br />It was a bit corney and watching Cristian Bale is hard to do after hearing his screaming rant temper tantrum he had while making the movie, its just hard to like or support an actor that is such a jerk in real life.<br />Cheers<br />Davyo
Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
All these glowing reviews for this one are obviously planted. This movie was absolutely TERRIBLE - BEYOND being a huge let down. A Terminator Film with this star power cast should be great, no? It is not. McG (director of Charlie's Angels, creator of The O.C. and Pussycat Dolls, to name a few) can not seem to be able to get a decent performance from his actors in this one (big surprise). The film is a watered-down mess - also a PG-13 - with NO on-screen deaths, and 1 death (off-screen) in the entire film. It's poorly edited, and VERY poorly written as well (writers of Catwoman did this one) - this movie was marketed towards kids, but it backfired and the kiddies didn't care. This film was so poorly received it even sent the company that made it, in it's first film, into Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Rent it before you buy it, because you're going to be disappointed and likely agree with me, just like most of the world. By the way - this "directors cut" is only THREE MINUTES LONGER than the theatrical version (NOT 40+ minutes, which was promised by the liar McG) - don't waste your money on this terrible, terrible film - if you must watch it, rent it first. This movie is so awful, I'd say even "Battlefield Earth" is better.
This film was atrociously bad.  I wouldn't watch it again if it was running free on network TV, much less buy a copy of it.  It was pathetic in all aspects...
Bought this movie as a Christmas present at a great price.  Saving on each present means more presents for the folks on my list.  Thank you Amazon for helping me out.
Terminator movies should have stopped after the amazing T2 movie directed by James Cameron. Terminator Salvation is by far the worst Terminator movie out of all 4. It really makes T3 look like a masterpeice, eventhough I did not likt Terminator 3 that much. Christian Bale does not fit as John Connor at all. I can't believe from what I heared that he will be in 2 more Terminator Films.<br />LET THE TERMINATOR MOVIES GO TO REST. IT IS LOSING ITS PLACE IN THE GREAT SCI FI MOVIE LIST.
I did not really like Termin. Salvation too much.  Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring.  There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me.  For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
The first couple Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmaker's decision to set the fouth installment in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance.<br /><br />A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad -- Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) -- who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand is Conner's babe Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter, who's somehow hooked up with Skynet.<br /><br />On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that's merely an excuse to string together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, people we neither know nor care about. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. It's simply too much. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfire due to extreme overkill. That's why they call it "overKILL." It's a curious thing but all too true.<br /><br />Be that as it may, there are enough worthwhile elements to give the film 3/5 Stars.<br /><br />- Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until Blair informs him otherwise.<br />- At about the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between Marcus and Blair sharing a brief warm moment in a world gone mad. If the film contained more scenes like this it would have been more effective.<br />- There's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters.<br />- Bryce Dallas Howard has a very uniquely beautiful face. She also has better curves now that she's older. (Would I even be mentioning inconsequential stuff like this if the movie were engrossing?)<br />- There are a some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you love action you'll get it here -- there are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots, Schwarzenegger-bots -- all trying to terminate the protagonists. Yet, strangely, none of the myriad actions sequences rival the ultra-thrilling ones in the previous three films and it's difficult to discern why beyond the reasons already cited.<br /><br />The first two films successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. "Terminator Salvation," on the other hand, fails to ever truly captivate and instead opts for wall-to-wall action, creating dull overkill. That's too bad, but it has it's moments; it's thankfully not as bad as "The Mummy Returns" in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot.<br /><br />The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico.<br /><br />Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings:<br /><br />T1: A+<br />T2: A+<br />T3: B+<br />T4: C
It goes without saying that the "best" Terminator film was the first, simply because it *was* the first! There is something to be said for originality, after all. Still I am far more impressed with "Terminator Salvation" for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />First, the theme of the other Terminator films is worn out. How many times can we watch a film about one terminator chasing some people all over the country before it gets old? I always found the brief war scenes in those films far more intriguing, and I often wondered why the script writers did not include a lot more of them. At last, they have! The whole film is about the war, and Skynet is no longer some distant, mostly unseen enemy but a true adversary who is visibly present in every scene. That is what I have wanted to see-- the WAR against the machines!-- not a single terminator chasing people a few people around in circles again.<br /><br />Second, the special effects of this film were awesome. Whatever might be lacking in terms of acting skills (which Terminator film had good acting anyway?), it made up for it with special effects. The Terminators are so realistic that I have literally had a few nightmares about them-- just the kind of scare I love from a movie! The only aspect that lacked realism is that the Terminators seem to be incompetent marksmen for being such advanced machines. How many rounds does it take to hit a target, after all? "Spray and Pray" seems to be how Terminators shoot, which results in far more misses than hits, and that makes little sense to me when our contemporary computer-guided missiles can strike with pinpoint accuracy. It also seems like an awful waste of ammunition to me. Nevertheless, I can see why it is a necessary part of the show. We could not have Terminators who shoot with pinpoint accuracy without blowing away all hope for human victory now, could we? Ah, such unrealistic elements are a necessary evil. This is science *fiction,* after all!<br /><br />All in all, this is my personal favorite of all the Terminator films. It may not have the originality of the first, but it is certainly the most impressive in terms of war scenes and special effects. This is why I am giving it a five-star rating.
This review has spoilers and assumes most people reading it have seen the movie (it's been out for quite a while), so if that's not you, you should probably skip this!<br /><br />I approached this movie from the position that Terminator 2 is one of the best movies ever made. So its sequels have a lot to live up to. I did enjoy the third movie, but Terminator Salvation is relievedly grittier, with more action and lots of scary robots. It's the year 2018, and John Connor is 34 and a lieutenant in the Resistance; his father, Kyle Reese, is a teenager somewhere in the wastelands of L.A.; and a man named Marcus Wright appears, having last been seen receiving a lethal injection in 2003. And yes. The external USB drive lives on.<br /><br />In the first half of the movie I was reminded so much of The Road Warrior (or Mad Max 2) because that movie was so brilliantly, awfully dystopian, just the vast, unforgiving outback splattered with blood, populated by seriously, ridiculously insane people. Marcus Wright, Kyle Reese, and the silent child (who looks very oddly like a young Janet Jackson) are up against the same bleak landscape, only dealing with machines with a singular agenda.<br /><br />I was also reminded of Robocop, when Marcus realizes he did not die but was instead merged with cybernetics and metal; and even Transformers, because of the height and bulk of some of the Skynet machines.<br /><br />The action sequences themselves are excellent, and you have to love the POV we're presented with when Connor's helicopter goes down near the beginning of the movie. The machines have always looked frightening, with their red eyes and body-builder necks, and I have to say they got my heart going in several scenes. There are fond homages, as is requisite with sequels, it seems: Marcus breaks out the windshield glass of a battered 18-wheeler; Reese says "Come with me if you want to live;" Arnold returns via CG.<br /><br />It was actually unnecessary to have the Marcus Wright character. The participants of the Resistance are up against enough as it is. His mission wasn't to kill John, or Kyle. So what was it? I can't even say, which means it must not have been that important. The movie didn't need a time-traveling machine/man, and the more I think about it, the more the character could be taken out of the movie with little damage done to the plot. Obviously it's not good for a main character to be so superfluous. (Yes, I know, he gave his heart; but as a writer I can tell you how easy it would be to just give John a different injury)<br /><br />Interestingly, John Conner ends up fighting a machine that was twice his protector in the past (a replica, of course). Though the terminator loses his "Schwarzenegger face" early, it is against him that both John and Marcus battle, and I found that kind of poetic and sad in a science-fictiony way. In the end, the terminator was always only a machine programmed with a mission.<br /><br />I have a problem with the forced romance between Marcus and Blair Williams, the young woman who fights in John's unit. In fact, I have a problem with any movie that injects romance "just because" and it happens ALL the time and I'm really tired of it. In this case, because Blair seems pretty plucky and self-sufficient, her feelings for Marcus, especially after finding out he's a machine, make her seem just kind of weak and stupid. The movie should have tried to emphasize that Blair lives in a world with too few real prospects for love, a world in which "not even if you were the last man on earth..." has to be re-thought, and how depressing that is. But Blair seems content to be a soldier and just accept life for what it is. Not exactly the mindset of someone who would immediately fall in love with a robot. It just wasn't well done, in my opinion, and there was a way it could have been and the writers/director missed the mark.<br /><br />Another thing that disappointed me was that it is set in 2018, not 2027 or whichever year people and machines began being sent back in time. I guess they want to start a new trilogy, but I think that's too much. This movie should have been about the end of Skynet, plain and simple. Why call it "Salvation" otherwise? I went in hoping to see John Conner truly save the world, not just move up the ranks. T2 was such a vast accomplishment, basically a perfect movie, that to try and keep the story alive will only continue to submit subsequent entries in the franchise to inevitable comparisons to a movie that can never be topped.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is very good, better than the third, and I appreciated how well done the action was because it's always so crucial to these movies. I think Christian Bale was a perfect choice for his role, and if you look at the John shown at the beginning of T2, there is scarily some resemblance in certain light. However, the need for the Marcus Wright character just isn't there, and it's depressing that the fight against Skynet STILL isn't over. At this point we can literally sympathize with the Resistance...
I'm guessing this is a contentious films for die-hard fans of the Terminator series and you'll either like it or loathe it. O.K., I'll admit from the start I am fan of the Terminator franchise and although I went to see this with some trepidation after T3, I have to say I came away pleasantly surprised. As a stand alone film (which may the best way to look at it) this is pretty good and as part of the overall series it develops the story well and has something to add to the previous films. It will never be as good as the first two films, but I'm glad to say it's better than T3. Bale is good as John Connor, if a little wooden at times, but the real surprise was Sam Worthington who has the best role in the film. The CGI effects are good, but not overbearing and McG's direction was ok, but a little too jerky for my tastes. You do get some cheesy lines in this film and plenty of nods to the previous films, but nothing too excessive and most produce a wry smile rather than outright groans. The main problem with this film is that you don't care about the characters that much. In the first films you wanted to know what happened next and considered the lives of the main characters, but in this film they are just faces on a screen delivering lines. It's sad but true and the main downfall of this film. If you go expecting your typical Hollywood action movie you'll be fine, just don't expect anything of great substance or anything as good as the first two films and you won't be disappointed. 3.5 stars<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
Don't get me wrong - this movie isn't terrible. Special effects are good, and the storyline is actually interesting and considerably more engaging than the one found in Terminator 3.<br /><br />But it feels like they're just in it for the money. John Connor meets his (teenaged) father in this film (before Daddy time traveled to the past to help Sarah Connor) and while this was a interesting twist, I felt it was a rather unneccessary story to be told. The part with the cyborg/former prisoner was more interesting, though, and it gives Skynet some more dimensionality than in previous films.<br /><br />All in all, a decent thriller like the third, just don't hold HIGH expectations and you'll probably enjoy it.
I thought Christian Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard had zero chemistry, though.  I felt no intimacy between the two of them.  His radio addresses seemed overly repetitive and empty.  I also thought it was odd how much fully functioning base infrastructure and military hardware still existed after J-Day.  I can suspend disbelief surrounding Connor having to rise up through the ranks to some degree.  And I thought the production values and action were excellent.  The opening sequence is breathtaking.  CGI Arnold worked.<br /><br />I still think the Sarah Connor Chronicles was vastly deeper and more thoughtful.  Fans who'd like to see more of TSCCs should know there's an effort underway to get direct-to-bluray or feature films done, possibly even the series brought back after Dollhouse and several other shows have been canceled and Glee is waning into cameo ridiculousness, but you will have to be vocal about it.  So post on the net.  Send letters.  Spread the word.  Don't just rely on a few of the actors and production people to push it through, as it's likely to never happen otherwise.
This fourth installment of the Terminator franchise simply isn't as good as the original "Terminator" or "Terminator 2".  But there are some interesting parts within the film, and some great action sequences.  The blu-ray itself has high-quality picture and sound.  There are two discs in this set.  One disc is the Theatrical Cut of the film.  This version also has the Warner Bros. Maximum Movie Mode feature (similar to the "Watchmen" blu-ray), which allows viewers to watch the film with commentary by the director.  There is also picture-in-picture features and a pop-up timeline.  Also, there are several branching "focus points", which allow you to pause the film and jump to a short featurette on some aspect of the film's production.  The problem is that there is too much waiting time in between pop-up segments.  You are often left waiting one or two minutes between each interactive feature, leaving you just watching the film.  A lot more information could have been put into the Maximum Movie Mode.<br /><br />Another disappointment is the second disc, or the "Director's Cut", which only features an additional 3 minutes of footage.  The changes made are barely noticeable, and don't add anything more to the story.  And just so you know, this set does not include the DVD version nor does it have a digital copy.  Overall: an average release for an average movie.
Terminator Salvation is the weakest of all the Terminator films, with one exception: Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright - he is terrific. He's even better in Avatar. And this year, he stars in Clash Of The Titans. Something to anticipate. Besides Wright, the film is pretty much just a lot of noise and special effects that don't add up to much. Even Christian Bale is the weakest I've seen him. It's almost as if he knows Wright is stealing the film away from him, and there's nothing he can do about it.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
If you like the Terminator Series, this movie is a must. It is a very good story line with excellent effects. There's only one part of the movie that I thought was a little "cheesy," but that's my opinion. I know what the reasoning behind it was, but I think it was just unnecessary. I won't say what it is because I do not want to spoil it.
To the action lover this movie will be greatly appreciated. I think that even those who are not so much impressed with action films will like this one.
I am not in a Reviewer's state of mind this morning - I misplaced that particular hat. I'll just keep it short. The special effects exceeded what I expected and loved one particular twist in the film. A lot of gaps were filled. Like the new Star Trek movie taking a different direction due to so many time line changes - you have to keep that in mind as you watch this movie. Future events thrown off track here and there yet with the main dynamics still soundly in place. Its worth purchasing or renting.  See, I told you I misplaced my reviewer's hat. Its really too early in the morning and not enough brain juice (coffee) to get my creative thinking processes going.  OH! And for the record - Christian Bale doesn't wear his cape this time. Darn! :-)
The story that are we were waiting for to continue one of the most interesting series of contemporary cinema
Better than Rise of the Machines but lacking any impact From lead actors .<br />A movie by the numbers relying on CGI and explosions like Star Wars 1 2 & 3.
They finally changed it up from the "a new terminator is trying to kill you and I'm here to protect you" scenario.  Good special effects and good story to entertain.
It was a great action film! The plot, actors, character development and directing were all fantastic. It's on the edge of your seat dram and I really enjoyed almost every aspect of it. There were only two things I would have done differently.<br />Fist, there was no humor AT ALL in this film witch was unlike the other T movies and I think it really needed it to cut the tension a bit and that is something I liked about the other T movies, especially T2.<br />The second problem I had was with the end. There was a heart transplant that seemed to come out of nowhere and was so dumb and unrealistic. It also took away one of the main characters that I would have liked to see in the next film.<br />I liked Christian Bail as John but I think Sam Worthington would have made a better John (he played the role of Marcus). The two should have swapped roles.
John Connor Blah - Marcus Wright AWESOME<br /><br />Didn't like the John Connor character at all.  Nothing special.  But Marcus Wright - the machine/man - he was incredible.  He was the real star of the film.  Like seriously he was.  It felt like it couldn't possibly be any other way than that he was the star.  And he was incredible - just a truly wonderful character.  The movie was ok, but the character of Marcus Wright was one of the best characters ever.  I also like Moon Bloodgood and her character, though they weren't nearly as good as Marcus Wright.
Our only Salvation is Christ.. however if we were all blown to Hell then John Conner may have to do something.. good action sequence and continuous action... at times maybe more than I would have liked but ... hey if its action you want then this movie delivers..
I was a bit leery about this entry in The Terminator franchise, but I found this film to both entertaining, but also better than the last installment. I can understand why they wanted to make this film as when the first two were made they either didn't have the money or the FX just weren't up to speed for such a futuristic story. Bale is sort of waste here as this is a sci-fi action film and he really doesn't get to show his chops. That's not to say I don't appreciate an excellent actor to help make the film more convincing. Terminator Salvation is not the best in the series nor the worst, but if you're in the mood for so good sci-fi fun then this might do the trick. I know it did for me!
Christian Bale out did himself as John Conner in this 4th extension of the Terminator Saga with a Dark side never seen before! There was no mercy or compassion for the proto type Terminator Marcus Right until that proto type gave up his life for John Conner. I was completely surprised at the ending of this movie and amazed at its impact on my own thinking!  Excellent story line and drama with the best visual effects seen since T-2  Th<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55HQ">Terminator Salvation (Widescreen Edition)</a>is movie definitely deserves 5 stars in my book!
This movie was sub-par. It was just called Terminator to sell tickets. I didn't enjoy more than half of this movie. It was OK. But the other three where so much better. For those of you who scoffed at T3, I think after you saw this one you where probably more grateful for T3 than you had been. Let's hope, since they did take in a little bit of a profit, if you factor in the worldwide total, let's hope the next one is better. Let's hope they get better writers and a better director and a better soundtrack. I'd hate to see the Terminator franchise meet its own Judgement Day.
I thought this film was a step up from T3's Terminatrix nonsense, but it still went downhill in the final 30 minutes as far as plot points go (thus getting four stars). The entire film relies on the predictions of the nature of time travel. Several very bad military errors were made, even some by Connor himself, that made me want to choke those who wrote the script. This just takes away from any enjoyment of or engrossment in the action and possible emotions of the film. Cameron's vision is ultimately lost where characters have not been developed to their full potential.<br /><br />As a woman, I see a failed role model in Blair Williams, who, far from what it appears they were going for, is more of a slut than a girl looking for comfort. I'm sure the boobery helped to sell the movie, however.<br /><br />The corroborating plot points with T2 are extremely overt and annoying. They were not well-thought out, but thrown in to give a sense of continuity.<br /><br />The parts of Kyle Reese, Sam Worthington, and John Connor are played by excellent actors, and it is their performance that carries this movie along. If not for the bad writing, this film could have been absolutely amazing. For those excellent actors, I still retain that 4 star rating.<br /><br />Even so, the recordings Linda Hamilton made were obviously rushed and I don't blame her. She was too good for this film.<br /><br />That said, this film should have been the real T3. I consider it so in my collection. It deserves a place because the predicted War Against the Machines has come. It had to come, and it had to be told, to give any weight to the prophecies of the first two films. Or.. maybe the mystery was better.<br /><br />As for allegations to the Director's cut not being worth it: it is nonsense to say that getting more film and features is worse than getting a theatrical version. Two minutes is two minutes, and I wanted to see it.
Wow, Terminator Salvation is actually a really exciting movie!  I went in already a big fan of the original three Terminator films, but Terminator Salvation really does a fantastic job continuing with the series.<br /><br />It's not a secondrate or cheesy attempt in comparison to the previous three Terminator films either- it's actually really darn good.<br /><br />I admit I mostly like the Terminator films because, well first of all, they are action-packed in a way that's pretty easy to understand and follow.  I simply *enjoy* them.  I know what's going on.  It's not science fiction created in a completely confusing way.  The storyline is what it is- machines are designed to kill humans and take over the world.<br /><br />Secondly, I feel a LOT of tension whenever I think about humans trying to run away from an enormous, dangerous machine created for the sole purpose of destroying anybody that moves.  I can't tell you how many dreams I've had where I was running and hiding as much as I could ONLY for a huge machine to suddenly show up and force me to continue running.  I love it!<br /><br />As for Terminator Salvation, there's some really cool additions to the machine creatures.  I really fell in love with the robot snakes (as I like to call them, hehe).  They are actually huge metal claws that hide in the water.<br /><br />Also, let's not forget the scene out in the desert with that HUGE machine that actually has motorcycles stored as a last resort inside his legs (I kid you not!).  Apparently whenever someone is out of shooting distance for this particular machine, he opens up his legs and sends machines on motorcycles after them.  Awesome!<br /><br />The storyline is typical affair however.  You *know* what to expect.  There's nothing especially hard to grasp about what's taking place.<br /><br />Overall, with todays technology and the way Hollywood delivers action flicks these days, the action scenes involving the robots going ballistic is just incredible and seems more believable now than it did in years past.  The same remains true here.  Great movie.
I went into this flick expecting a big, fat flop.  But what I got was a suspenseful, informative movie with a driving plot, exceptional acting, and a few splashes of memories of sweet days gone by.  I am SO glad that Christian Bale signed up for this one.  His presence was the kicker.<br /><br />Many movies that are at the fourth installment are bashed by critics and slammed by the masses before they even reach the public eye.  These movies are destined to fail simply because they are preternaturally steeped in "sequel" doom and, therefore, expected to fail.  With Christian being there, you know that the entire production team was aiming for quality, and they did not disappoint.  There were many edge-of-your seat moments and plenty of pure suspense to go around.<br /><br />Even though the scene with Ah-nold in it was computer generated, it was awesome to see him again in a movie.  Actually, it was a bit bittersweet.<br /><br />Because of the success of "Terminator: Salvation," there has been ANOTHER sequel ordered.  Let's see if they can bring it, yet, once again.<br /><br />GREAT JOB TO ALL INVOLVED!  MY TERMINATOR HAT IS OFF TO YOU!
TERMINATOR SALVATION<br /><br />STARRING: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Anton Yelchin, Helena Bonham Carter, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Jane Alexander, Michael Ironside and Chris Browning<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: McG<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 21 May 2009<br /><br />It's fair to say that most everyone has a favorite movie franchise they like to geek-out on. As I am no exception, the Terminator series has always been my favorite. Unfortunately for me, I'll have to pretend Terminator Salvation doesn't exist.<br /><br />The futuristic post-apocalyptic side of this story is indeed long over do; but making a Terminator film without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is like making Jaws without a shark. Throw in the facts that James Cameron walked away from the franchise (that he started, I might add), two films ago; and that this is the first installment to be watered-down to a PG - 13 rating; and it seems absurdly pointless. Nevertheless, the film exists anyway.<br /><br />It's been six years since we left John Connor and Kate Brewster in a fall-out shelter at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You would think the look of the Terminator would only improve with time, but you'd be sadly mistaken. For whatever reason, yet again, a character that was visually perfected years ago (1984), has now shown up computer generated.<br /><br />I ask the redundantly un-answered question again, with a breath of desperate annoyance - WHY? Why does Hollywood continuously feel the need to take amazing characters and transform them into computer generated pieces of garbage? George Lucas did it to his very own Yoda, nearly twenty years after he looked more than real in 1980; so why should I even be surprised anymore? Rumor has it there is to be a remake of Spielberg's classic, Jurassic Park. At first I was excited, but will God actually allow them to do the T-Rex with CGI (computer graphic imagery)? Let's hope not.<br /><br />As if using CGI wasn't bad enough; did they really need to make the new Terminators appear to have some sort of physical birth defect to their face? Why are their heads so small? If you haven't seen the film and don't know what I'm talking about, check out the cover of the single disc DVD. If the filmmakers aren't going to take their own movie seriously, how do they expect us to as audience members?<br /><br />The character of John Connor has not once been played by the same actor in any of the four films. This time, Christian Bale gets a shot, and surprisingly was the worst Connor yet. Bale plays Connor with less human emotion than the Terminators have. And I'm not sure if they began shooting a few scenes of this while he was wrapping up with The Dark Knight; but he randomly has the same annoying scratchy voice he had as Batman! What is the deal?<br /><br />The problem with the Terminator movies is that you really need to have an open mind when it comes to the plot. They ask us to buy that John Connor had his father Kyle Reese sent back through time, to save his mother Sara Connor, from a pesky Terminator. If you go with it, it's a lot of fun. If you stop and dwell on it though, it will give you a splitting headache. For the sake of this review, we'll just go with it.<br /><br />In this one, we are in the future nearly the entire time; with the exception of the first few minutes, where we start back in 2003. We meet a new character named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Marcus is on death-row. For dark personal reasons to be revealed later in the film, he volunteers the use of his body to research, for Cyberdynde Systems (the company that generated Skynet - a stream of computers that became self aware and created the Terminators, thus causing Judgment Day).<br /><br />From there, we jump to 2018 in the middle of the nuclear holocaust between what few humans remain alive, and the self aware nightmare Skynet. John Connor is the only survivor in an attack and stumbles across Skynet's hidden secret: a massive assembly line of T-800 Terminators. Schwarzenegger's brand, in case you were wondering.<br /><br />Connor delivers the message to his chain of command. They plan on taking Skynet out, based on data that leads them to believe they can stop the hellish machines, with some sort of signal.<br /><br />Where did this signal come from? Who knows? Why didn't they use this signal to begin with instead of the excessive sending back through time drama? Because this is the third sequel and let's face it, they're reaching. Folks, that's the best explanation I have for you.<br /><br />Something I could not figure out for the life of me, no matter how many times I re-round the DVD; was why the character of Marcus goes skipping across a river like a thrown rock. He falls from a bridge that has been blown up (which looked awesome, by the way), and then sure enough, goes skipping down the river, bouncing like a ragdoll. Aside from bad directing and editing, what could have possibly caused this to happen?<br /><br />Also, in the scene with John Connor and Marcus sharing a conversation in the water, everything seems to be hatched out quite nicely between the two of them when Marcus turns to leave. So why on earth does Connor scream at him angrily, "What are you?" Was this accidently placed in the film out of order? On the day when Christian Bale lost his cool with that sound guy, perhaps?<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of the series or not, Sam Worthington will be the most rewarding element the film has to offer you. By now, you surely know him from Avatar (ironically also generated from the mind of James Cameron). He is a true gift to action-movie fans: a guy who can play the butt-kicking hero, while being able to act extraordinarily well. You won't find too many of those.<br /><br />Had it not tried to be a Terminator film, it may have been a little better. The action is intense and the cinematography is breath-taking. We see some really cool new machines that were done very well with CGI. But this only made me question again, why the Terminators looked so horrible.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film was its ridiculously un-original third act. If you've seen the first two films, then you've already seen the ending to Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />Remember when the T-100 was first frozen and then sent into a vat of hot liquid metal at the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day? Same thing happens to a Terminator in the climax here; only in reverse order. And do you recall in The Terminator, when they had that climatic showdown amidst all of those machines, and Sarah Connor went toe-to-toe with the Terminator; and there was the suspense of the Terminator climbing up the stairs and her having no-where to go? Yeah, well if you don't, it's all here again for you; nearly frame for frame.<br /><br />This may be considered a SPOILER, to some, but I like to think of it as more of a friendly courtesy; to point out that they also CGI'd Arnold's face onto the body of another actor, for a cameo. I guess these filmmakers didn't realize the technology that now exists to digitally reduce wrinkles and make someone look incredibly younger; as used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. They didn't have to make Arnold look like he did in the first two films, either. All they had to do was take off six years; he looked great in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Guys, come on.<br /><br />If I had to guess, they probably did this because they weren't able to get Arnold on-board, with their poor excuse for a script. And of course Arnold would have had to train insanely to get his body back to where it was; as he did for the third film. But if that's the case, then you don't use a shot of Arnold at all, hello! You come up with something else, original. Why do these huge studios and directors insist on settling for crap? Crap may very well be cheaper, but it's not as appealing to the eye.
I was never a big fan of the Termintor franchise after the first film. I thought T2 had great special effects (and a knockout performance by Linda Hamilton) and T3 was an amusing send-up but they both lacked the freshness of the original. Thankfully Terminator Salvation takes the series in a completely different direction while still keeping in theme with the first movie.<br /><br />What really makes T4 a thrill for me is that the actors make the most of their somewhat typical screenplay. Christian Bale is good as usual but Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin rise above their flatter dialogue and give us characters you want to root for.<br /><br />The special effects in this film are also great, but unfortunatly loose alot of their impact on DVD. The transfer tears a bit and like most things on the small screen it's easier to pickout where the green-screen begins and the real actors end (some of the cooler stunts look laughable on DVD).<br /><br />So like I said, if you liked the movie Terminator Salvation is still a must buy. It you are bothered by an unperfect copy then best to test out the Blu-Ray.
Back in 2003 as I was driving with my Mom from seeing Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and we starting with ideas about a possible 4th film. We mentioned it taking place in the future where Humanity was actually at war. That there would be no more Terminators going back in time to help John Conner since the end of T3 showed the beginning of Judgment Day at the end. Low and behold the makers of Terminator Salvation decided to do just that. Taking place in 2018 the film shows an end of world scenario kind of like 28 Days Later, where most of Humanity is dead, or underground fighting and hiding from the Machines. It points to a bleak world where Skynet has enslaved some of the Human Race. Terminator Salvation was a much better improvement than T3: Rise of the Machines. Not that T3 was alwful, but it could have been more darker, less humorous. This film was dark and lined up with T1 and T2 in James Cameron style. I was very surprised by the cameo appearance of you know who if you watch this film. I was surprised not to see the T-1000 or T-X models but I don't know if they have been invented yet in this period of the future, although Skynet mentions "they've sent their best Terminators in time to defeat John Conner and all have failed". This film stayed in storyline with the first 3 films, and has a great cast along with Sam Worthington that kept audiences guessing. You can have a good Terminator film without Arnold or Linda Hamilton. It was great though she lent her voice though and Christiane Bale did a great John Conner. Overall the film is perhaps one of the best sci-fi films of 2009.
Not as bad as I was expecting it to be but certainly the worst TERMINATOR movie (yet). SALVATION has got the action, the chases and the explosions but one really couldn't care less about the characters, with the women being the very worst (what was the point of bringing Jane Alexander out of retirement for a bland two minute role?). It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor often, grab his shirt and throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators seem to be too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon. No wonder the sense of excitement has pretty much gone from this series.
In regards to DVD Extra's, you have to buy the 2-Disc Edition at Target. It has the same extra's as the blu-ray edition. So if you don't have a blu-ray player, go to target and get the movie there.
I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!
(**Contains minor spoilers**)<br /><br />First off, this is not Arnold's Terminator. If you're expecting the same thing as the first three, you'll be disappointed by this movie. Nor is it a serious philosophical work. It is simply a continuation of the first three, from a somewhat different -- but not contradictory -- light.<br /><br />The story follows John Connor and Marucs Wright, two very different individuals whose fates nonetheless seem intertwined. Connor leads a raid against one of Skynet's prisoner-holding facilities; in the process, many die. Connor makes it out alive, but so does someone else...Wright, who was being held in the facility, emerges a few minutes after Connor is extricated. Thus begins a long, twisted path on which both men embark. Along the way, they find themselves on the same team -- often doubting the other's intentions -- and yet at odds when the dark secret of Wright's resurrection -- after his execution before Judgment Day -- comes to light.<br /><br />Meanwhile, they learn that Skynet is using them both to ensnare Connor as well as Kyle Reese, in order to manipulate history in their own favor; at the same time, Skynet is manipulating the Resistance itself, offering up a sort of "Trojan Horse" in order to take out high command.<br /><br />There are many twists and turns along the rocky road to "Salvation" -- personal, and of the Resistance -- but both men make the journey. In the end, one will sacrifice all to give the other a chance at life.<br /><br />Now, aside from my brief retelling (trying not to give away too much), my opinion. It's very well done, and highly enjoyable, to me at least. Obviously, there are many who disagree. But I enjoyed the twists and turns, and actually saw the movie several times while it was playing at my local theater. Would I recommend seeing it before you buy it? Yes, if for no other reason because so many are so disappointed in it. I, however, think it is one of the best, if not the best, in the series -- certainly better than 2 and 3 imho. Keep in mind that my parents were from the generation that saw and loved the first two in theaters, and I'm not; and, frankly, I don't know how much my Dad -- who loved the first -- would care for this one. I approach this having seen the first two around when T3 (which I wasn't terribly fond of) came out.<br /><br />Also, this is best seen more than once to make certain that you catch everything; for a "light" movie (which it certainly is), it tends to jump about, and make sudden detours. Not unpleasantly, to me at least, but there it is. My advice? See it with an open mind, and don't expect a masterpiece. If you do, you might like it; I personally thought it was awesome.
Let me begin this by saying that I am a very big Terminator fan. I loved the three previous films, the third being the weakest in my opinion, and even loved the way that the television series was so true to the mythology of The Terminator. Though the Terminator Salvation did stay true to the mythology in terms of characters, location and historic story development.it simply fell short. Mc.G is an okay director....though the only thing I really half like of his is Charlies Angels full throttle. The cast is outstanding, and do put in a good performance...but the overall story of the film is wanting. Unlike the previous Terminator outings this film is not about fighting the future...instead this film is about a futuristic fight. The Terminator story line was simplified into a futuristic war movie. Don't get me wrong...it was kinda cool to see the war with the machines in live action...but they could have and should have done more to make this story not only follow the mythology but "feel" like a Terminator film, quite literally you could have called this film Transformers 1 1/2 and it would have been just as good. The need for the future to be unknown, changing, and chasing after the present is one of the coolest things about the Terminator movie franchise and is one of the things that is desperately missing from this film...and keeps it from fitting comfortably in the Terminator series.<br /><br />I literally felt robbed after this film, not only does the film not feel like a Terminator movie...but after its all said and done, as a viewer you realize that it was nothing more than a set up for a squeal. The failure for the Production Team to get the idea of the Terminator Mythos correct is devastating to this movie, and the shotty writing and reliance on spacial effects to carry the film is it's downfall. In short this movie is allot of popcorn fun...but a very bad Terminator Movie.
Terminator 4 is a disgrace to the Terminator series. The movie does not focus on the war that fans were expected to see. They do explain how John Connor becomes a Leader and he does not show any qualifications as a leader. The whole story focuses on a stupid guy who is considered to be a decommissioned Terminator. Near the end they have this guy talking with a jumbo computer wich is so lame and reminds me of the computer system from "I-Robot". The Kyle Reese Character is also too young and is extremly wimpy!!! Come on, John Connor is going to send this little guy to go back in the past and do it with his mom? They don't even expain how they send him back through a portal or whatever. Man this movie is totally awful!
This was the first Blue Ray disc that I bought and I have to say the Terminator Salvation movie was so poorly mastered that I could not tell the difference between this "HD" blue ray film and an old regular DVD quality film on my HD tv. Even broadcast looks better on my TV...Story was mediocre, and special effects were OK ...would have been better if this was a REAL HD movie instead of this crap full of unprocessed picture noise.
I read a number of the reviews about this movie [especially the 1 star ratings] before I rented it.  It was not the train wreck that I was expecting.  The introduction of different types of terminators was a nice concept.  Up to the point, the only terminators we knew of there the T-800, T-1000 and the other in Terminator 3.  All of them were humanoid.  The movie introduces some that are far different.<br />The story holds true to some of the previous movies such as Katherine Brewster is John Connor's wife (and pregnant).  The planet does not look nearly as devastated after the nuclear war as it did in previous movies.  It seems a LOT of the military survived the war.<br /><br />*** SPOILER  ***<br />In the previous movies, John Connor was being protected by everybody.  This time around, it is Kyle Reese who has to be guarded to protect the time line.  The introduction of the Marcus character was not particularly cared for by me.  It seemed to be an add-on to the main "save Kyle Reese" story line.  Helena Bonham Carter is interesting as Skynet but had a "I, Robot" feel to it.  I was also disappointed the that time travel aspect was left out of this movie.  I wanted to see how the resistance was going to seize the time travel equipment and send back Kyle.  The digitalization of Arnold's face on the T-800 was cheesy looking but was appreciated by me since I saw Terminator back in 1984.<br /><br />It is worth watching.  However, I am not sure that I will add it to my DVD collection or not.  The jury is till out for the moment.
"Terminator Salvation" is the beginning of a new saga in the "Terminator" franchise which begun in 1984 with James Cameron's hit "The Terminator". Directed by McG, this takes place fifteen years after the events of "Terminator: Rise of the Machines", which ended with the onslaught of "Judgment Day", the day when all the world's machines rose up against humanity.<br /><br />John Connor, this time played by Christian Bale, is now settled into his prophetized role as Resistance Leader/Only Hope for Humanity against the terminator machines. Yet Connor struggles with his mission as the great emancipator/warrior and Bale shows this internal strife very well. As we get to know Connor and his ragtag group of rebels, we see the two people entering his life who play major roles in his fight: Marcus, played by Sam Worthington, a death row inmate from several years ago who took part in a scientific procedure (which ended up converting him into a human/cyborg hybrid) and Kyle Reese, well portrayed by Anton Yelchin. Reese, of course, one day becomes the father of John in the earlier Terminator mythos, yet John is tasked with finding him and keeping him alive in this alternate time frame.<br /><br />Though not always as lively, fast paced as the earlier Schwarzenegger films, T-S has a few well produced set pieces (for example: the road/bridge chase involving Marcus, Reese and a couple of terminator/motorcycles; the capture of rebels by a 20 ft harvester/terminator; and Connor's battle with a Schwarzenegger cyborg lookalike). The aftermath of Judgment Day has led to his new chapter in Connor's life and his fulfillment as a savior of humanity and it somehow still works without the presence of Schwarzenegger, simply because it takes the story in a different direction and adds new layers to the original mythology.<br /><br />The Film looks great on Blu-ray: Strong visuals and a clear soundtrack do enough to enhance McG's vision. A very good addition to one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made.
I won't convolute this review for Terminator Salvation with my opinions about the other films in the series, the Terminator mythology, or what have you; I'll simply say that - even as a stand alone film - Terminator Salvation...  is very good.  Sure, it's driven, to a degree, by special effects and action with choice little bits tossed to long-time fans, but I found it to be an entertaining, well-made film.  And the story is good also.  Foretold leader of the resistance against the machines John Connor (Christian Bale) is NOT the main character; though his role is not insignificant (or poorly acted, in my opinion).  The film focuses more on the newly-introduced character Marcus Wright (as portrayed by Sam Worthington); whose part in the film serves as an interesting standard for comparison against the John Connor that survived Judgement Day and has seen war.  I'd say Terminator Salvation is not about metallic, single-minded killing machines, great action, or obligatory explosions; though it certainly is not lacking in these things.  It's ultimately a story about moral responsibility, strength of character, and - humanity.  These subjects play out from the perspective of Marcus as well as Connor, and neither character comes off as one-dimensional.<br /><br />Really I'm making more of an attempt to avoid spoiling the film than I am to exaggerate its themes; it is, boiled down to basics, a solid action film fueled by great special effects.  The "Terminator" is still a unique and frightening "movie monster," and John Connor is a brave man struggling against seemingly impossible odds.  Add to the mix Marcus Wright, a man with a shameful past and an unexpected second chance, and you have a worthwhile film with characters in which you want to believe and follow throughout the course of the storyline.  Yes, I've been fairly vague, but I encourage anyone that has so much as even considered seeing the film to give it a chance.  And anyone who just plain appreciates well-done action, movie magic, or creepy human-exterminating robots from the future (I know I do) shouldn't pass up Terminator Salvation either.<br /><br />Now that I've done my best to make a case for this movie, I'll address something else: with the blu-ray version (I can not speak for the DVD version) you get both the PG-13 theatrical version of the film and the R-rated "director's cut."  Having watched both, I'll say that the PG-13 version isn't really less-satisfying, and the R-rated version didn't seem to add so much "adult" content as to even warrant the upped rating.  I'd say that all three of the previous Terminator films were bloodier.  Of course, this film (unlike its predecessors) is more action than thriller, so it makes sense.  And the "worst" thing added to the R-rated version of Salvation is some brief (and not especially showy) female nudity.
3 stars because I like the movie, but the Director's Cut is as the others have stated. Maybe 3 - 5 minutes of some added scenes but not enough to make it a movie changer. Personally I think they could've kept it at a PG-13 rating...
I am glad that I did not waste money on this film (got it from Redbox - free night's rental).  The story line was confusing.  The film didn't really explain (unless I drifted off during the explanation) how the main characters got to the past or present or whatever time they were in.  The main character was in the movie with his father who was just a teenager at one point.  I'm not sure if the son traveled to the past or if the father was in the future.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of scardy cats watched this film and wrote reviews, but I didn't think the robots were scary/creepy at all.  The plot was so predictable that you couldn't possibly be scared because you knew what was going to happen already.<br /><br />Anyway, it is something to watch on a cold night, especially if you want to complete the series.  Although, I don't think any of the original characters are in there.  One of the robots at the end did look like Arnold (a well built Arnold lol), but it wasn't long before he was reduced to his metal skeleton.<br /><br />My advice, save your money and rent it for $1 or wait 'til its on cable.
This movie is all action, no talk! Well, some talk, but the action is so intense that the story and variety of scenes in this movie suffers greatly. Sam Worthington plays a character--Marcus--that seems to come out of nowhere. There was no mention of him in any of the three previous Terminator movies, and this movie seems to be mostly about him, even centered around him more than John Conner. And him getting hooked up with some hot babe in the desert was really CORNY and soap opera-ish. He's a machine, for crying out loud!<br /><br />I was hoping that this movie would center around the start of the relationship between Kyle Reese and John Conner (father and son, you know), not this Markus dude. He played a noble character, but I thought it was an unnecessary addition to the grand Terminator tale. Hopefully the next sequel will hone in on Reese and Conner more.<br /><br />As with a lot of action movies these days, this flick didn't have a lot of charm and variety to it. This is not entirely the fault of the screenwriters, of course, since the setting is, after all, post-Armageddon with everyone living like savages in constant misery and fear--not a lot of room for comic relief and witty one-liners as in Terminator 2. And of course, having no Ahnold (aside from a brief appearance of a Terminator of his likeness) just isn't the same! And Linda Hamilton is sorely missed as well! So obviously this flick isn't going to be as all-around entertaining as Terminator 2.<br /><br />I thought all the scenes of the Resistance fighting the machines looked straight out of an Xbox or PS3 game, exuding that same vibe you feel when playing a video game. And that's fine for teenage boys, I'm sure, but I'd rather the movie seem more like a regular movie, overall.<br /><br />So for hardcore Terminator movie fans, I wouldn't recommend against adding this movie to your collection, but I wouldn't call it a must-have, either.
Spoilers!<br /><br />I was having a pretty good time with this movie.  The special effects were solid, the storyline fairly cohesive and Sam Worthington's performance was strong.  I fully expected Marcus to not survive the movie, but when they arrived back at the rebel camp I had was pleasantly surprised he survived the fight at Skynet.  Then the massive, huge let down with him volunteering his heart to save John Connor.  The really irritating part is John nodding to him like "Good show old chap, I'll make good use of it".  Marcus had every bit as much right to "life" as it were and was the most compelling character in the film (much more so than Connor/Bale).  He would have made an excellent torch bearer to carry on the fight and could have breathed new life into the series.  As it is we get a stupid ending with Bale set for another sequel.<br /><br />For those saying it would ruin any congruity between Salvation and previous films, Connor already stated his mother's recordings make no mention of such a "terminator" - it could be explained as the time line unexpectedly shifting (just as it would have if Kyle had been killed).<br /><br />John Connor should have died, Marcus should have lived.  The last minute re-write (from what I heard) spoiled this film for me.
After seeing so many really-bad and so-so "blockbuster" movies recently, I was extremely pleased with this one.  Highly recommended.  Oh, the blu-ray treatment is top-notch too.
I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatre and I loved it again when I got my copy on blu-ray, the action sequence, the special effects, the script, well, I was entertained, call me crazy for all those people who gave<br />this a movie a bad review, the audio and video on blu-ray, I give it 4 out of 5 stars, Sam Worthington, I think<br />that man has a bright future in Hollywood, loved his performance. For the people who will decide to add this<br />movie to their movie library like I did, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did, I will see it a few more<br />times for sure.
I had high hopes for this film.  I have to say it failed on almost all levels.  I gave it 2 stars because it does look good.  However that was it.  The plot was dreadful the script even worse. If you have to watch it how many times do they yell "hang on" it is like a drinking game with Keanu Reeves.  I like Bale and was suprised at how little they gave him.  And what was with the child who did not speak.  What a blatant Hollywood ploy to try and create some emotion, just awful.  Wait for cable for this one as you will not be happy if you own it.
good cast, good story, great effects. good to watch in order..<br />  ...<br />... ... ... .... .... ... ... ..
Outstanding; much more substance compared to other Terminators; acting on a much higher level due to Christian Bale.  The most satisfying of all, now for Terminator-Victory!
I gotta give this movie and actors, writers, director props. It's not a great film by any means. I just watched it for the 1st time since it came out and thoroughly enjoyed it. I hated it when I saw it in the theaters and never bothered to watch it again until now. 1 and 2 are so good it is hard to accept anything less, but I suppose I finally could see it as a stand alone (like Terminator comics and games) and it is pretty *beep* good. Still dumb *beep* like T-800 throwing Jon around when he should be snapping his neck, but hey it isn't perfect by any stretch. I like that you can take or leave the 3rd one since it doesn't follow it directly.<br /><br />This one doesn't suffer from the *beep* camp in that movie and thank god it is not another car chase/remake. If you want a Future War film, this is it, warts and all. Plot is actually really good, with some good twists and mystery. One thing I appreciated more this time was how the villain, refreshingly enough, is Skynet itself this time and will operate much differently than a human army or one cyborg sent back in time with a simple mission. Sort of hard to follow as far as what Skynet knows and doesn't know, but that puts us in a similar position as the humans in the movie.<br /><br />It's too bad this didn't do better b/c I'd like more (hopefully T5 and 6 by William Wisher happens!). If people can see this as something new (FINALLY breaking away from Arnold and the chase plots; very, very glad to hear to dropped out of T5--in favor of Fast and Furious? Lol) it may finally develop into the prequel/sequel series (time travel screws with its place in the series lol) that it has the potential to be. With William Wisher involved it just may. More please!
I really enjoyed this movie, as a Terminator fan I was wating long for the aftermath of the judgement day event..<br /><br />The movie doesn't actually follows the same timeline as the original date, there's no laser guns and no T-800 walking around in packs.<br /><br />Nice performance from Chistian Bale and Sam Worthington, great fx and sound.<br /><br />The director's cut edition really leaves you kind of dissapointed as there's no valuable new material...
I almost didn't watch this movie because I could never stomach Christian Bale & by the time I was finished watching it, I had totally changed my mind about him!! I now LOVE him but especially adore Sam Worthington!! This was top notch special effects & amazing acting by all in the movie. The story line was fantastic and well written also. I think I have watched this at least 20 times already and I never get sick of it! I totally recommend this to add to your "Terminator" collection.
Terminator salvation is one of the best movies. I was happy to find it avaliable to download. I watch it almost every week.
I had actually watched his forgot about it, rented it realized I had watched it and thought very little at it.<br />Basically the series lost all momentum, in this movie.
It is what you would expect, but in a good way, for those who are interested in the action/drama genre
I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen.  I still love it now.  Great movie, ton of action and great acting.  If you love buying action movies, this one is one to buy.
The emphasis on story may be gone but the gritty style of this movie will leave you yearning for a more worthy succesor to the terminator films.
This movie is good. People are complaining it wasn't R rated and Schwarzenegger wasn't in it and so on. I thought it paid more respect to the franchise than the silly part 3. This was well acted and did a good job of showing the results of the needless part 3. The first two terminator movies are the classics in the series and honestly it should've ended after 2. But you know Hollywood. Nevertheless I enjoyed this film and nostalgia won't cloud my view on that. I heard Arnold hated this but liked part 3. Ah no. Much love but 3 was a joke in my opinion. One thing I wish is that Chris Nolan helped do the marketing with this because: why in the world would you give away that Marcus was a terminator before the movie was released? That was stupidity and it took away from the film's impact. All in all I was entertained. But they need to end this franchise because the story is going to get more absurd and convoluted.
Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version of Terminator Salvation, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.<br /><br />And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale. And you've got to give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn (the guy who played Reese in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9RB9Y">Terminator</a>.<br /><br />But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2:</a> delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.<br /><br />Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental
I just finished watching this movie with hubby an hour ago for the first time. I never seen or new there was a Terminator 4. I just new about Terminator 1 and 2. When I looked up 1 and 2 to order off of Amazon I found out about 3 and 4. I now have all 4 Terminators. I've been watching each one in order the past few days. And I think Terminator 4 is a good movie. I don't think it is the best Terminator. The 3rd Terminator is the best one, but I enjoyed it just as much as the other three.
Im a big fan of the Terminator Franchise and so i bought this movie to go along with my collection.When the movie arrived the case was scratchy witch wasent exactly what i was looking for but long as the disk was ok i was ok over all good movie.
Visually and action wise, okay. This is an obligatory part of the series - the problem is that it showed in the directing and script. I think one key part of the plot revealed itself a little soon and tensions could have run a lot higher throughout. The original is still the best. This kind of movie really demands to be taken seriously, although that is probably a little difficult after they botched the sequel to the first installment with that goofy stoned kid, lazy directing, and half baked cheesy lines. It's a shame since the story is a postulation of things soon to come. (If you scoffed at that last comment, look up the word postulate). It really should have been treated with more reverence. Getting around in this wreckage of a fantasy world is too easy. They could have shown off more of the Jeep's capabilities and the effort needed to make it through some areas. It lacked a journey and was more just snapshots of events. Still decent though if you've at least seen the first one.
It's more than 25 years since Arnold Schwarzenegger first uttered the words "I'll be back" in Terminator (1984) and in that time there have been three further instalments about the rise of the machines under Skynet and of the mother and her son (Sarah and John Connor) that would become pivotal to mankind's ultimate victory in the end. While the first three Terminator films dealt with time travel and Skynet's attempts to kill John Connor, McG's Terminator Salvation is set during the war that we have only previously had glimpses of.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation begins in 2003 where Dr Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) convinces a Death Row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to donate his body to science. Wright duly obliges and after being given a lethal injection his remains are at the mercy of Dr Kogan. The devastating Judgement Day occurs the following year in 2004 when Skynet is activated and perceives mankind as a threat, opting to wage a horrific war on the world. Our focus quickly switches to 2018 where John Connor (Christian Bale) is part of the Resistance against the machines but is not yet the leader we are familiar with from the prophetic visions in the other films. Connor is revered by many as a future saviour and treated with utmost respect while others question the validity of these claims. Connor's problems in the war mount when the Resistance learns that Skynet are planning to assassinate specific members of the Resistance within a week. While Connor is second on the list, another Resistance member, Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin) is the primary target, being the one later chosen to go back in time to protect Sarah Connor in the 1980s but also to become John Connor's father during that mission. Meanwhile Marcus Wright emerges in 2018 and begins searching for Dr Kogan but along the way he meets Kyle Reece and they join forces. Following Reece's capture by Skynet, Wright heads for a meeting with John Connor to enlist the help of the Resistance in a daring rescue mission. Connor, eager to prevent Reece's death and therefore his own, also volunteers to test a new radio frequency the Resistance believes can shutdown Skynet and its machines and lead to the end of the war.<br /><br />As with the other Terminator films there is potentially the path to some head scratching as the protagonists look to ensure not only John Connor's survival but more importantly that of Kyle Reece. It was interesting having John Connor as just another member of the Resistance and during the film he has the chance to demonstrate his potential as a leader. Connor is somewhat stubborn, abhorrent of the authority and orders of the Resistance leaders whose scepticism of him as mankind's saviour mean they are happy to forsake Kyle Reece once he's been captured by Skynet, despite Connor's pleas. In the end victory is all that matters, but with Connor having been through encounters with terminators prior to Judgement Day he knows how crucial both he and Kyle are. In an interesting twist Kyle is a young rookie in Terminator Salvation, already adept in combat but not yet the battle-hardened soldier he was in Terminator.<br /><br />This is the first time we have been fully immersed into the war between mankind and the machines and inevitably it's effects galore throughout. Only released in 2009 I somehow expected some of these effects to be better and I felt there was too much emphasis on them to carry the film. I can't blame McG too much for this. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was so groundbreaking with its effects that anyone trying to do similar with future incarnations would inevitably struggle. The historical context of the film sees Skynet only just developing the T-800 Terminator that featured so memorably in the first film. Instead we have older models that are still reminiscent of the terminators with a metal skeleton infrastructure but they don't have the same fear factor. While some terminators patrol the barren wasteland looking for human prey, others burn rubber on motorbikes while Skynet's machines scour the world from the sky and even send giant robots to capture humans and take them back to the main headquarters. As fascinating as it was to see the war in detail I was left lamenting the loss of the mystery built up in the first films with those teasing glimpses. Brief shots of Terminators crushing skulls beneath their mechanical feet and opening fire on the Resistance stayed with you long after the film, but Terminator Salvation has undone all that. The original films always seemed to depict the future war to be conducted beneath dark skies which seemed to emphasise the bleakness of the struggle. Terminator Salvation veers between day and night but is most effective during the twilight exchanges. The addition of dialogue used in the previous films and even the odd image just made me nostalgic for the other instalments.<br /><br />While John Connor fights continuous battles against both the machines and his superiors we have the story of Marcus Wright unfolding. After Kyle Reece is captured, Wright befriends a Resistance member Blair (Moon Bloodgood) in what is a weak romance plot. Blair leads Wright to Connor but even before stepping on a mine and revealing the truth of what science has done to him it's already pretty obvious what Marcus Wright's secret is. Both Connor and Wright join forces to storm Skynet and rescue Reece and we do get a welcome introduction from the newly developed T-800 models and in one instance a familiar face returns! In the end an average plot is resolved with a very corny ending as Connor and Wright put their differences aside with one making the ultimate sacrifice for the future. Terminator 3 was quite good but had it not been made I wouldn't have minded, while Terminator Salvation is nearly two hours of a very thin storyline, elaborately decorated with glossy effects.<br /><br />As interesting as it was to see the war between mankind and the machines Terminator Salvation offers very little that is engaging. The absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot be ignored and though Bale and Worthington do try they sadly cannot fill the Austrian's shoes. I'm sure I read three Terminator films were planned depicting the future war so one can only hope Arnie will return in some capacity, otherwise I will approach any further films in this series with some dread.
