"Mulberry Street" is not so much about rats who turn humans into flesh-eating monsters in New York City. It's much more basic than that: it's all about tension and about how much can be crammed into a single story. The rats are more of an afterthought, really--they may serve as the catalyst for a medical crisis, but when their job is done, they conveniently disappear. That's a good thing, because at a certain point, we don't pay attention to them anymore. What we do pay attention to is how the tension builds. And that's why this movie is so effective; it does nothing but build itself up, and it keeps building even during the end credits. I repeatedly asked myself what would happen next, and that's always the sign of a good horror film, especially one so taut, brooding, and fatalistic.<br /><br />The best thing is that it tells an understandable story without lingering on extensive character development. The first named billed in the opening credits is Nick Damici, but that doesn't mean he plays the main character. I don't think there is a main character in this film; it takes place in a rundown New York City apartment located on Mulberry Street, and the people who inhabit it live in a kind of community. Damici plays an aging boxer named Clutch, who eagerly awaits a visit from his daughter. Clutch's friend is Coco (Ron Brice), a gay man who probably has stronger feelings for Clutch than he would care to admit. But Clutch seems to show an interest in Kay (Bo Corre), a single mom who gets by as a bartender. Her son, Ross (Tim House), is a detached teenager, showing no interest in school or in life. The only thing he seems to be interested in is photography, and he takes plenty of pictures even within the confines of his room. The building's elderly men--Charlie (Larry Fleischman) and Frank (Larry Medich)--function on dependent levels; one wheels an oxygen tank around while the other seems to be getting confused about things.<br /><br />The one character who exists outside of the apartment complex is Clutch's daughter, Casey (Kim Blair), a military officer on her way home from serving in Iraq. Her face is covered with scars, and she tires to cover them up by letting her bangs down. She initially doesn't say or do much, but we still get the sense that's she's incredibly insecure about the way she looks, and is probably more insecure about her military status. There's a moment when a train platform custodian thanks her for her service to her country; she says a polite thank you, but doesn't express any pride or show any sense of accomplishment. In a later scene, in which she rides a train, a woman talking on a cell phone sits in front of her. This woman gives subtle yet significant signals, indicating that Casey's scars are making her uncomfortable. Casey picks up on this, and tries to compensate by letting her bangs down once again.<br /><br />It isn't until the rat crisis that she begins to apply herself. The same can be said for the characters in the apartment complex--a large rat, thought to be dead, bites the building's superintendent. Soon after, he begins to feel funny. Hair grows on top of his ears. His sense of smell becomes inhumanly strong. He develops a taste for raw meat. The tenants don't suspect anything until they start watching the news; apparently, a full-blown epidemic has taken hold of New York City, one so deadly that the American government has decided to quarantine Manhattan. Rats have bitten people all over the city, and it doesn't take long for these people to transform into mutant creatures with a taste for human meat. It quickly becomes a matter of survival, pitting a handful of Mulberry Street residents against an entire apartment full of flesh eaters.<br /><br />I'm probably making this film sound like a low-tread rehash, but that really isn't the case. This is a story that doesn't depend on a scary idea, but rather on how it shapes itself around a scary idea. Since many of the characters are engulfed in shadow, and since most of the terror is hidden in complete darkness, not much is seen when the creatures attack. A lot of what happens to the victims is left up to the imagination, and that's rarely done in horror movies these days; we have to think about their fates, and thinking is always scarier than actually seeing. There a point at which one creature is trapped in Clutch's closet; when Coco reopens the door he sees that the creature has chewed its way through the ceiling, meaning that it's now loose within the walls of the apartment complex. It doesn't matter where it went or if we even see it again--all that matters is that we no longer see it and that we don't know what will happen next.<br /><br />The concept of rat/human hybrids terrorizing New York is downright silly, yet the people behind "Mulberry Street" were able to make it seem real. And consider the fact that a hint of satire runs all throughout: a billboard for developer displays the slogan "The Neighborhood is Changing," and a newscaster solemnly reports that help isn't arriving fast enough for the hundreds left alive in Manhattan. The President (whoever that is in this story) has declared a state of emergency, but information is being gathered too slowly to be of any real help. This only adds to the sense of isolation felt by the Mulberry Street tenants, increasing that overwhelming sense of What Now. This is a dark, unnerving story, one that refuses to let the audience relax.
I have to say this film caught me by surprise and is one of my favorite horror films ever made.  The genius behind the film is the excellent writing that focuses on the depth of relationships between the characters.  As the film starts off, you get a glimpse of the various characters going through another day in their lives.  Meanwhile, you catch glimpses on the TVs in the background that something bad is beginning to happen in New York, but life goes on.  The spreading epidemic is nothing but background noise.<br /><br />Needless to say, the situation spirals out of control and hits home as the tenants of the building fight for lives as the city falls apart around them.  I almost cried twice, but the end had me bawling (and I was not the only man in the theater who was reduced to tears, but the intense emotional climax of the film).<br /><br />The writer/star of the film wrote a prior film about the unspoken love between men and that theme returns in this film as a gay tenant struggles with unrequited love.  I have rarely seen a gay character handled so sensitively in popular cinema- much less a horror flick.  These are very real characters, not a bunch of models, scientists, sheriffs, or other horror cliches.  Don't miss this movie!
Holy cow! I'm not one to get all excited by an indie horror movie but this movie would have to be the exception.<br /><br />The people of NYC are under attack by rats. The government has quarantined Manhattan and all hell's broken loose! Those who've been bitten have mutated into "rat people."<br /><br />This movie makes you care about the characters which makes it that much harder to see them die. I really liked this flick and highly recommend it.
For the second year in a row we have been graced with the After Dark Horrofest. Well saying "graced" my be a bit overboard considering almost every film developed under this festival has been a disaster to sub par at best. We love the horror genre and encourage the whole indi film movement but there has to be some substence to what we're watching or why bother? Short on budget doesn't mean it has to suck. All it means is you have to rely less on killer effects and dish up a good story with some realistic chills. Mulbery Street actually succeeds in this way to an extent. Not so much scary but the concept definately has a chill factor. Who wouldn't get scared by being preyed upon by rat zombies in a tenament home?<br /><br />Our story takes place in a New York City tenament home where 6 seperate residents are dealing with the fact that their complex will be demolished due to an urban renewal. One great aspect of the film is the believability of these characters. It's not a bunch of young kids aimlessly running around getting picked off as in the typical horror flicks of today. It's actual real people living their everyday lives. The main character is a former boxer and his close friend who are awaiting the boxers daughters return from Iraq. Then there are a couple of guys who live on the upper floor, one being an elderly man who needs an oxygen tank to survive, and a single mother and her son. So you start to actually care for the characters instead of routing for them to vanish. As they all go about their day the super is trying to get the water to work in the boiler room. While working he's bitten on the arm by a rat. Within minutes he begins to have strange symptoms. He goes upstairs to rest and starts to see hair growing on his ears.<br /><br />The more time that goes by the worse he starts getting and it becomes obvious to everyone that something strange is going on. The news continues to report rat attacks throughout the city. Roughly every five minutes new breaking news appears stating the rat attacks are becoming so frequent they must suspend all subway service and want everyone to remain inside. What they don't know is that these rats are passing some strange virus around which are turning the infected into rat like zombie creatures. It's a lot like 28 Days Later but with a different storyline. From here on out you follow each tenant as they work together to save themselves from the rat zombies. It does become intense at times and overall is an enjoyable and creepy film. The use of atmosphere is key in this one. They really did a great job driving home the chills in that way. The camera lighting is very dim and you get a very claustrophobic feeling while inside the cramped apartments.<br /><br />Overall the film was good with some flaws. But why be so cridical on an independent film. Considering the small budget they did a great job. The focus on atmosphere was awesome and the acting was really good. A couple cool facts about Mulberry Street is how they had to shoot essential footage in the middle of the crowded streets of Manhattan without any official permission to film there, and how all the actors in this film are friends or in some way related to the director, so none of them received any payments. Not bad when you factor all that in. So if you're looking for a great film you won't find it in Mulberry Street. But if you go into it expecting an above average indi flick you will really like it. It's definately worth checking out.
The After Dark series is a great collection for horror-flick lovers out there.  All the films have good stories, and although most had low budgets, I think it adds to the appeal.  There are a lot of great, gritty horror scenes in this collection.  I particularly enjoyed "Mulberry Street" which has a young, up-and-coming actress named Kim Blair.  Blair gives a chiling performance fighting off the infestation that plagues Mulberry Street until its haunting, climactic ending.  She is defintiely a rising star in the industry and I hope to catch her in future releases.  Defintiely worth the money!
This movie has all the elements of a zombie movie, but with rat people instead of zombies, and it is fantastic. I really enjoyed the small things about the movie like how all the actors were just ordinary people and not models flown in from California, it gave the movie a bit more realism. Like I said earlier, it plays out like a zombie apocalypse, but with much more agile opponents, that raises the fear factor tenfold. As cheesy as the movie sounded it really was pulled off incredibly well, it was dark, bloody and explicitly somber, with an ending that left me begging for more. The best of Horrorfest '07? I would have to say so.
I just pre-ordered this item; I'm so glad it's coming out on DVD. Saw this film at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it. It's smart, witty and devilishly creepy with a great script and an excellent cast full of groovy New York character actors. The director and production team pull off an impressive feat of presenting a slick, polished film with fully-realized characters and spine-tingling creepy crawlies, all on what seems to have been a modest budget. Good job, folks! Can't wait to see what they do next.
My expectations have generally been low for horrorfest films, and most of the titles in this batch have done little to change my mind. However, Mulberry Street is a character driven film that actually indulges emotions deeper than simply fright and the desire for bloodlust. There has been mention of the similarities to 28 Days, but that was far more global. Where Mulberry differentiates itself is in the characters it develops both before any of the horrors occur, as well as during the chaos. We are introduced early to a small group of people with ties to, where else, a Mulberry Street tenement. Their reactions, relationships, challenges, and fears are followed throughout the film while the rest of the city collapses around them. The antagonist of the story, if you will, is a virus derived from rats causing residents to become enraged, flesh-starved beasts. While there are plenty of the graphic scenes that are typical in a movie like this, the focus remains on the plight of our small band of tenants. Because we know them and do care, their collective fates do concern us, and there is an emotional resonance to their suffering. Some are the moments are frightful, many heart-wrenching, but all heartfelt. There is a feeling that this is a drama placed in a horror setting, and it doesn't disappoint.
This is a story idea that could've gone very wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this film was done.<br /><br />It was very Indie-looking from the beginning, with gritty film stock and no-name actors, but after worrying for the first few minutes that this could mean "cheesy", I realized that the film felt authentic instead. I was made to feel a part of the community of Mulberry Street, so when things start to go wrong, I felt as anxious as the characters.<br /><br />I like films that make me forget that I am watching a film. I like it when I get lost in the world I am watching, no matter how fantastical the situation may be. The writers / director kept a story very grounded in "reality", that could've been silly  or unbelievable. They didn't over-explain or show too much of the horror / gore of it all. I think the best horror stories are the ones where the audience feels as though they are secretly peeping into other peoples' worlds. We get to sit in our comfy chairs and watch their safe little lives fall apart in a horrific and disturbing way. This film pushes it just far enough without breaking that line where "suspension of disbelief" becomes "that would NEVER happen".<br /><br />If you like all things horror, old school style, I think you will like this film. It is clearly made by people who love the genre and care a great deal for the underground art of move-making. I hope to see more from these writers and director. They have a new fan.
While I love horror movies, one about rodents usually aren't my thing.  However, I enjoyed almost all of the 2006 Horrorfest films, so I was excited to find out there were more the next year!  Mulberry Street is the first of the 2007 Horrorfest films that I watched.<br /><br />I happened to watch it the same week I saw "I Am Legend" and while they are certainly similar in subject matter, they're both very different films.<br /><br />Mulberry Street is pretty good.  The film is choppy and extremely dark, which frequently makes it hard to tell what is going on.  But, that kind of adds to the suspense.  The actors are all superb, especially the performances by Kim Blair and Nick Damici.  The movie spends a lot developing the characters.  All of them are interesting human beings with a story and not the usual "hot" bunch of teenagers.<br /><br />The ending was a little bit of a shock, but I don't need neat, tidy endings all the time anyway, because let's face it life isn't always neat and tidy.<br /><br />Good film.
Let's admit it - After Dark Horrorfest FIlms are weak - there are not many worth seeing for free let alone buying one.  BUT Mulberry St.  is the exception.  This was a fantastic film and with what it lacked in budget, it made up for in strong casting, character development and direction.  This is a truly solid film, with a lot more depth then you'd think you'd find in a horror film these days.  It has a humanistic element to it that the director and cast capture perfectly, which makes you care about the people on the screen and what's going on.  I am happy to have this film in my collection.
This is one hell of a solid film. In fact this the film I'd kill for. This one has all the right story elements I crave and a gritty, realistic style that doesn't try to fake.<br /><br />The acting is solid for a bunch of unknowns, which is good as the director really cared enough about the story to give us the best of the best. The story is well-thought out and incredibly creepy. I once had a dream about rats and this is like that nightmare only ten fold.<br /><br />I love the suspenseful pacing as when the stuff hits the fan it goes into a frenzy! I love the music in the barroom when the rat people begin attacking, very wonderful and carefully timed moment in the film.<br /><br />The story revolves around the tenants of Mulberry St. aparment complex scheduled to be torn down because of a big shot developer in town. The big thing I noticed is that the developer is acknowledged, but not enough to be distracting like a random scene where he is acting villianously. This would've killed the momentum here, as the story is about the people of Mulberry St., not the developer. So future director's please note you don't have to over do the villian, just make him present.<br /><br />Mulberry Street makes you care for it's people as it's everyday Joe Lunchbox, your friends and neighbors, that dysfunctional family down the street. Average people suddenly thrust into this out-of-control situation slowly building in the background. What's great about the film is the tension is like a rubber band, when it breaks, it explodes in your face and all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />The film has a very unique look to it as well, ranging from the artsy cover-your-hind-end shots to build up the story, to the gritty-down-in-the-trenches-filming-a-war shots that accent the action. Mulberry Street has atmosphere! Oh boy does it have atmosphere and does it play it up well. It's creepy and gritty, then it's sunshine and blue skies, alternating to make the horror all the more creepy.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is the when the daughter is returning from Iraq and she's running on foot through the park. The playground is obviously in shambles, hinting at something terrible happening without a dead body in sight, making the panic more believable when you hear the distant screams.<br /><br />And while you rarely see the monsters, you know they're there, hiding in the walls and crawling through the roof (one instance a chimney).<br /><br />In all I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM! Absolutely! Anyone who is pursuing a career in film should sit up and take notes from this film, because this is how it's done!<br /><br />50stars out of 10.
MULBERRY ST. is about what happens when a plague strikes NYC. However, this is no ordinary disease. This rat-borne illness turns anyone bitten by the nasty rodents into quickly-mutating, vicious, cannibalistic, rat-humanoids! No one is safe as the plague spreads throughout the city. A small group of apartment building tenants must make their final stand against the marauding hordes of murderous mutants! MULBERRY ST. is a micro-budget movie that actually works. Costing far less than $100K, the acting, writing, and inventive camera work combine to make it loads more fun than most zillion-dollar hollywood epics. The strong, interesting characters and atmosphere remind me of classics of old like BASKET CASE, STREET TRASH, or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The closest contemporary work would probably be FEAST. If your taste runs toward the ghoulish / apocalyptic, then you'll be in rat heaven w/ this creeper!...
Mulberry Street (Jim Mickle, 2006)<br /><br />28 Days Later... ripoff that could have been so much better than it is, but actually isn't half bad. Co-written by Mickle and star Nick Damici (In the Cut), featuring cameos from Larry Fessenden and Debbie Rochon, and about a plague of mutant rats chowing down on New York City--what's not to like?<br /><br />Plot: the rats in New York turn deadly after mutating; their bites turn New Yorkers into bloodthirsty homicidal maniacs. The action revolves around a tenement building on Mulberry Street whose surviving tenants--including an ex-boxer (Damici), a drag queen (Basquiat's Ron Brice), a barmaid (Sad Spanish Song's Bo Corre) and her son (Maid in Manhattan's Javier Picayo), and a World War II vet (Larry Medich) and his son (Fast Horses' Larry Fleischman). Oh, and there's the boxer's daughter (Our Lady of Victory's Kim Blair), home from the Iraq War, trying to get back to the building, but having a hard time after the city shuts down the subway system because of the rat attacks.<br /><br />What's not to like? Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise for you, but let me just say that this would have been just as good a movie--no, a much better movie--without the credited "creature effects". All you have to do is turn people into bloodthirsty killers and you've got yourself a story. You don't need to turn them into monsters as well, unless you've got a portion of your budget specifically earmarked for special effects. I knew the flick was going to go downhill early on, when the building super (Tim House), who's been bitten by a rat, starts growing hair on his ears very quickly. Oh, no, I thought, you're not going to take this really fine little horror flick, which is actually working as a suspense film during the inevitably slow beginning, and try to turn it into a generic monster movie, are you? Oh, but they did. I almost wept.<br /><br />The other major problem the movie has is that there are so many places where the script starts to branch out into complex, interesting character development, so many stubs that tell us that given a little more time and another rewrite or so this movie would have given us a plethora of characters we could have come to care about. None of those stubs, however, ended up growing legs. There's an aborted romantic subplot, a lot of backstory with the boxer's daughter and what happened to her overseas (though I was impressed they scrapped the almost-inevitable teary comparison between the horrors of war and the horrors of rat-bitten homicidal maniacs), some bonding between the barmaid's son and the boxer that never goes anywhere, a bit of weirdness with the (stereotypical, but hey) creepy super, all of which could have been expanded, but never went anywhere. Depressing. But I chose to look at this as a movie made by a couple of guys who really have the potential to get good at this moviemaking thing, and with Larry Fessenden coming onboard (his production company is bankrolling Mickle's next film, also co-written by Damici), I have high hopes that some of that potential will be realized next time out. I'll be looking forward to seeing what they come up with. ** ½
Speaking as a rat lover, I have to give this movie five stars for originality if nothing else. I just wanted to open up my review by saying that, mainly because it amuses me.<br /><br />Anyway, this DVD is part of 2007's '8 Films to Die For' series, and I've been quite excited about all of them, even though I was not fortunate enough to catch them in theatres this year. For those not in the know, they are eight indie horror flicks with a limited run pushed by After Dark Films. However, they also tend to be 'love it' or 'hate it' films. Myself, I fall into the former camp, and in general love horror movies. Even the bad ones are enjoyable to watch...<br /><br />This particular one was actually quite original. The long and the short of it... a plague of were-rats running amok in New York city. Like I said, its quite an original concept, which really got me excited. And it did a fun job capturing the atmosphere of urban New York. While it may not stand out as a masterpiece of cinema, it was a very enjoyable movie, which is all that really matters in my opinion. Its definately worth checking out for the horror buff, and it has enough gore to keep anyone happy. Plus rats... errr, rat-people at least. Also, scream queen Debbie Rochon makes a cameo as a reporter, for horror buffs like myself.<br /><br />As an added bonus, like the other 8 Films to Die For, comes with episodes of the 2007 'Search for Miss Horror Fest' contest. Not really relevant to the film in any meaningful way, but still fun to watch. Especially if you like reality TV meets half-naked Goth chick horror fans (and what red-blooded man wouldn't, I ask).<br /><br />So I definately recommend buying this DVD. I've been making my way through the other outings from 2007 pretty steadily, and have liked them all so far (and am eagerly awaiting Frontiers). But this one was especially enjoyable... Then again, I AM a rat lover, so I guess I'm biased.
I have to say for a after Dark film it was not to bad. Its better than the first batch they threw out at us. The script follows of group of people living in a run down apartment building. The plague is spread through rats and once bitten you transform into rat. Thats right you transform into a rat. Not completely but just some of the features. This makes for a intresting take on the whole eating people thing. Instead of zombies you are rat-people. The movie starts out kind of slow and then finally picks up then they unleash the carnage. It kind of ends there but for the most part it is entertaining. Just dont aspect to much. The acting is average the gore pretty good. I say its at least a rent but maybe you would want to watch this one before buying.
Both last year when I got to see the original After Dark Horrorfest in the theater and this year when I had to wait until they came out on DVD, I managed to watch almost all of this films without knowing anything about what they were.  The streak ended with "Mulberry St," because in addition to having a suggestive tag-line for the film ("There's something below us worse than Hell"), the cover of this DVD has a quote from Bloodydisgusting.com that this is "A 'Zombie' film that breaks the mold."  Last year when there were a couple dozen of us who were seeing the 8 films 2 die 4 in the afternoon one of the guys sitting in front of me (we pretty much sat in the same places each day) missed the beginning of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKDC">Wicked Little Things</a>" I quickly filled him in on the prologue and added that this was probably the zombie film.  For some reason we thought that the eight films would represent eight different genres: e.g., one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKCI">Japanese ghost movie</a>, one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKBY">Dark</a>, one [[vampire flick]], etc.  Okay, so we were wrong for thinking there was a rhyme or reason to how Lionsgate picked these films out of their massive DTV bin.<br /><br />Consequently I was aware that "Mulberry St" was a zombie film when I put it in last night, although to be fair it is really a "zombie" movie, the punctuation indicating that technically all of the hungry people in this 2006 flick are neither dead nor living dead, ergo, not zombies.  The story is set in New York City where a deadly infection transmitted by rats turns the citizenry into flesh-eating non-zombies.  So you know this is a "they're coming to get you, ha-haaa!" film, and you can discover the rest for yourself.  The title of the film  (a nod to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0007169922">Dr Seuss</a> perhaps?) is something of a misnomer, because this is not about all of the people on that particular street reacting to what is going on, but rather focuses instead on six recently evicted tenants who are trying to stay alive inside their crumbling apartment building.  But since the building does not appear to have a name (at least not one that I remember), the street name makes more sense.  The strength of this film, especially compared to other Horrorfest offerings, is that we have a real sense of the individual characters.  I also liked the way the apartment building and the things that people had in their apartments became critical parts of the fight to stave alive.  My main complaint with "Mulberry St" is that it takes a while to get to the good stuff, and while I acknowledge that the time is spent developing the aforementioned characters, I still thought things were dragging out a bit and was about to zone out on the film when things finally hit the fan.<br /><br />This movie is primarily Jim Mickle's baby.  In addition to directing the film and co-writing it with actor Nick Damici (who plays Clutch), Mickle gets screen credits for editing, sound, and visual effects.  So what you see is what he wanted, and the net results are pretty good.  This is a horror film where you can have a favorite character who may or may not be the "hero/ine" and know that they are going to have their moment.  I picked up a definite "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y6Y2">Night of the Living Dead</a>" vibe from the film, and that did indeed turn out to be the case, albeit it a bit more proactive (think "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KPHZG">Straw Dogs</a>" and finding things around the house to use as weapons).  My understanding is Mickle shot this movie on location and that it is Damici's apartment, redressed several times for the various occupants, where most of the action takes place.  Plus, Mickle gets a bit lyrical at the end, which is not inappropriate given the care with which he has crafted his little film.<br /><br />This concludes my run of one 2007 After Dark Horrorfest movies late at night and part of the reason I decided to round up on "Mulberry St" is that it is one of only three of the 8 films 2 die 4 that actually has bonus features on the DVD besides (all together now) the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes.  In addition to deleted scenes there are also outtakes, storyboards, early director sketches, tests for makeup and visual effects, and a behind the scenes bit on the rats.  None of these were outstanding, but it was nice just to see evidence that these filmmakers had worked stuff out before they shot the film (maybe the rest lake these bonus features because they did not do this sort of prep work--it would explain a lot).  My immediate gut reaction after watching the 2007 films is that collectively they were a notch below <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA6C1I">Horrorfest 2006</a>, but I am going to sleep on it, do the math, and make my case <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012RCNDM">tomorrow)</a>.
This movie is one of the best zombie movies out there!!! I think every zombie movie collector should have it!!! If you are into great ironic or tragic endings like  on night of the living dead, then you should get this one! highly recomended!
Mulberry St. actually turns out to be a pretty decent film. I went into watching it with an open mind because some of the After Dark films turn out to be crap but with this one, you actually start hoping the characters will make it through, even though you are pretty sure that they won't.<br /><br />The characters are all living in a run downed apartment building in N.Y. and there was no surprise to me that it did have rats anyway. An epidemic breaks out because rats start biting people around the city and all hell breaks loose. Certain people in the building get bit and then it's an allout race as to who can defend themselves and who can't. Check it out and watch the WHOLE film. Not once did I feel like I had to shut it off because it is THAT good and keeps you wondering throughout the whole film.<br /><br />I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Great characters, good plot(even though we know this won't happen-Rat People), great suspense building and ok camera work(could've done a little better but not all that bad). Also, it had some good gore scenes(rat people eating other people) and some ok makeup work.<br /><br />One of the good films in the series.<br /><br />DD
Well this was a nice surprise in the 2nd group of After Dark movies!  I really enjoyed this flick unlike some of the other uneven offerings we usually get with this series.<br /><br />This movie builds characterization, suspense, a sincere feeling of dread and is truly a "horror" film!  Hallelujah!  I think the best way to see this movie is on a big screen at home, watching this in the theater I would probably have been motion sick because I don't think the camera ever stops moving but that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />The story revolves around an epidemic that is breaking out around New York of random violent acts.  What is causing this?  Rats are biting people turning them into rat zombies.  Sure it may sound stupid but it is a really unique horror film and the pace is set very quickly early on.  The story is basically a rundown apartment complex is being overtaken by rats that turn people into zombies.  While this doesn't sound like much, it's the way the characters interact with each other that gets the most attention.  There are some eerie scenes and enough blood to please the gore fans but it's not just a blood and guts movie.  It really analyzes the relationships of the tenants and how they handle/help each other during the crisis.  It's really a story of how during adverse conditions people really pull together to help each other.<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth your time and you will also probably find it an enjoyable way to spend 84 minutes.<br /><br />The extras on the disc are minimal, I believe there were only 2 deleted scenes and just a few outtakes but while low on the special features this film really delivers a punch.
I've been slowly getting through the second lineup of the After Dark Horror Fest library, and not finding anything particularly good either.  That was until I came across Mulberry Street, which judging by its synopsis sounded like a pure cheese-fest.  I was ever so glad to learn just how wrong I was.  In New York City, something is very, very wrong with the rat population.  The people that they bite are turning into mutant beasts with a taste for human flesh, and it isn't long before the denziens of a run down apartment building are fending them off to survive as the city soon comes under martial law.  What's the most surprising about Mulberry Street is how director Jim Mickle actually manages to get you to care about the characters, and make these otherwise cheesy horror events come off as actually scary and suspenseful.  Other than its conclusion and its tired 28 Days/Weeks Later filming technique, Mulberry Street still ends up being a solid horror flick that delivers the goods.  All in all, if you only end up seeing one of the After Dark Horror Fest flicks, make sure that it's Mulberry Street.
If you've read the plot then you are probably thinking the same thing I was, "Rat-People??"<br /><br />"Mulberry Street" was quite surprisingly the best "Horrorfest" movie I've seen yet and proved to be one entertaining flick. The story was good, the characters were good, the budget was good, the picture quality was good, and so on and so on.<br /><br />Downsides-<br />In two brief scenes the effects crew chose to use CGI fire. CGI fire always, and I do mean always, looks corny.<br /><br />Upsides-<br />The film gives a lot more then expected.<br />The "Rat-People" actually looked very decent. They kind of resemble what would be the love child of a zombie who "mated" with one of the ugly vampires from, "From Dusk Till Dawn."<br /><br />If you are a fan of viral outbreak/zombie (*think "28 Days Later")/apocalyptic films then you will definitely enjoy this one. "Mulberry Street" has definitely set the bar for future "Horrorfest" films.
I'll be brief this time. No long winded verbal exhaultations....<br />I loved this flick. The characters were quite familiar, as i grew up in NYC..they were very real and convincing. The film, though dark at times (even in the dark shots you could see clearly what was happening), rolled along beautifully. I felt during many moments..that i was there with the actors.<br /><br />The premise wasn't anything new, but it was done in an original way. There was some blood and guts...but it wasn't important either way, I was drawn in to the film as the tension built, and it showed how vulnerable we are when we live in the city...especially in a cramped tenement.<br /><br />It was good to see a horror film that was obviously done by fans who have love for this genre of film, especially in this present day mega-bucked hollywood film making that is plain garbage.<br /><br />Mulberry street was a throwback joint (a back in the days flick),combined with a modern style of film making. I have a lot of love for this Indie flick which by no means was sophmoric, corny, cheesy or any other adjective you wish to hate with...<br />Good make up effects...great acting...tension, adrenaline..and I guess im getting soft, because it had an emotional ending..<br /><br />Long live Mulberry street..long live the Independents<br /><br />Hollywood can kiss my A**<br /><br />PEACE
I didn't think that I would like this movie,I thought that it would be just a dumb B movie! But I was pleasently surprised by this movie! This movie really made me care about the characters and made me wonder who would still be alive at the end. It was also nice to see some Latino characters in a good movie, since Hollywood seems to have forgotten about us. But I digress, Mulberry Street is worth watching even though the premise of people turning into Rat/Human hybrids seems silly at first but then again people accept Werewolves and Vampires and other assorted creatures just fine. This movie is worth a watch, I don't think that you'll regret it!
This movie is pretty good. a diffrent take on a creature/zombie movie. i'm really not sure which one it really is zombie or creature. but i do think that it was pretty good. these b rated horror films are great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
Growing up as a Long Islander who was born in New York City, I had a love/hate relationship with the city. On the one hand we viewed it as the centerpiece of the world - everything new, trendy, and interesting appeared there first and made its way to the surrounding tri-state area.  On the other hand, it was dangerous, dingy, and frequently disgusting.  My grandfather lived in a "railroad apartment" with walls that had never been repainted and floors that were never cleaned.  And that's the setting for Mulberry Street.<br /><br />Anyone who has been in one of these apartments knows them on sight, and Mulberry Street is so authentic that you can practically smell the musty rooms. The camera's claustrophobic view of the interior apartments hides nothing - this isn't a movie filmed in Canada pretending to be in New York.  It's the unglamorous, gritty side of the city that is everyday life for so many New Yawkers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mulberry Street has several strikes against it.  Let's start with the title: Yes, it's a street in Manhattan, but it's also the name of a Dr. Seuss book.  The plot, which is essentially a zombie survival horror sans zombies, features an infection carried by (SQUEAKING SPOILER) rats.  Yes, rats. Wererats, to use a Dungeons & Dragons term.  Infected rats in the sewers begin biting people, which in turn transforms the civilian populace into flesh-eating rat-people.  In full light, they look about as ridiculous as it sounds.<br /><br />Director Jim Mickle wisely spends his $60,000 budget by using old military props, keeping the camera's focus tight, and the scenes dark.  The infection spreads throughout New York City and the film's plot, from rat to little girl to building super, told mostly through radio and television broadcasts. The cast of characters includes the washed-up boxer Clutch (Nick Damici), his Iraq-war veteran daughter Casey (Kim Blair) who is ashamed of her internal and external scars, Clutch's gay long-time friend Coco (Ron Brice), attractive but haggard mother Kay (Bo Corre), her truant son Otto (Javier Picayo), and the requisite cranky old men: oxygen-dependent Charlie (Larry Fleischman) and his addled friend Frank (Larry Medich).<br /><br />The film subtly demonstrates how the apartment complex is a complicated web of small interpersonal bonds that form a larger family.  Much of Mulberry Street's horror is watching it unravel: between roommates, between parent and child, and between perfect strangers.  If you can ignore the rats, zombie fans will enjoy this little horror film dressed in rat's clothing.
It may not be very polished, but Mulberry Street (2006) is an extremely effective little horror thriller, with true to life characters, and gritty mostly believable situations.  Shot with a limited budget, the production has a very intimate and cozy atmosphere, that adds to the believability.  Image quality suffers at times, and some of the shaky imagery is irritating, but the story is very effectively told, and barely gives you any reason to question the presentation.<br /><br />The story takes place in New York City, where something that turns people into flesh craving fiends, is being spread by rats.  The events unfold over the course of one day, and are centered on the activities of some of the residents of a condemned apartment building on Mulberry Street.  Nick Damici, who co-wrote the screenplay, plays Clutch, one of the residents.  He jogs in the neighborhood, works out on the roof of the building, and is expecting the arrival of his daughter Casey (Kim Blair) an ex-soldier injured while in the service.<br /><br />Bitten by a rat while doing repairs, Ross (Tim House) the building handyman, is one of the first of many victims.  Clutch's neighbor Kay (Bo Corre) follows the progress of the widespread outbreak, while tuned in to the TV news at the bar where she works.  The disease spreads fast, and the epidemic is soon out of control, with public transportation suspended, areas of the city quarantined, and people being attacked in the street.  The initial response from the government is slow, leaving the victims to fend for themselves.<br /><br />Clutch secures things at home, getting friends to lock themselves in their apartments, before heading out to check on Kay.  He manages to get Kay out of the bar, and while headed home, runs into his daughter who is driving a stolen truck.  Once Clutch gets back home, things focus on the attempts of the residents to keep the infected hordes at bay.  The diseased are dubbed "rat bastards", as over time the malady causes some to resemble rats.  They are relentless, and can move quite fast.<br /><br />Zombie tales seldom turn out well.  Miraculous solutions are quite rare, so the focus is usually more on the struggle to survive.  Mulberry Street may not feature actual zombies, but it follows a familiar pattern.  It's easy to buy most of what happens, as a core group bands together to survive.  The cast is very believable as working class folks, with authentic dialog that is only occasionally exaggerated.  The story unravels a little near the end, as the action ramps up to a frenzy, for a climactic finish.  There are some overdramatic elements, such as when old friends return to visit, but they are not stretched out gratuitously.<br /><br />Despite budgetary constraints, director Jim Mickle tells a gripping and frightening tale very well.  The special effects are limited, you don't even see a gun, but what is presented is quite effective.  The dark atmosphere and tight framing helps to draw you into the situation.  The writing is solid, and the cast does a great job with the material.  And there's no place with the mystique of New York City.  If you accept it for what it is, you may be pleasantly be surprised at how effective a thriller Mulberry Street is.
This is one of my favorite films, and it isn't the horror part of it.  My wife hates horror films, but I had to get her to watch it.  She really enjoyed it.  The story and characters have been described before so I won't.  But what I had to talk about is that this movie doesn't descend into the depths of humanity. It goes for the goodness of people.  Sounds a little strange, what I'm trying to say is that it isn't like the 'Night of the Living Dead' with the man hiding his family in the cellar and fighting off the other people.  The people here are neighbors and they act like it.  They try to help each other, even if it cost them their lives.  The people are real, with faults and all, but there is no greedy or cowardly idiot like almost every horror film has.  It was one of the first After Dark Horrorfest movies and it's why I try to pick them up every year.  Every year there is a lot of crap, but there are also a couple of gems like this, such as 'Lake Mungo' or 'The Abandoned'.
This movie took me by surprise.  Yes, the concept of people turning into giant, violent human/rat hybrids does seem silly on the surface, but luckily they don't spend too much time on the 'monsters' themselves.  No, the real star of the movie is Mulberry Street, and the apartment complex the characters in the movie reside in.  This isn't the santized Manhattan you have been seeing for years in movies by Disney, Woody Allen, or Nora Ephron; this is the gritty, cramped, and claustrophobic urban chaos you saw in movies like "Dog Day Afternoon", "The French Connection", and "The Warriors", and I couldn't be happier to see it (just don't ask me to live there).<br />  Basically, the plot of the movie concerns a zombie outbreak without the zombies.  The filmmakers do create a great sense of tension throughout the film, although they can get kind of frantic at times with the jump-cuts.  The nominal hero of the movie, an ex-boxer named Clutch, waits for his daughter Casey to come home from a stint oversees in the military, while he also waits, along with the others in his apartment complex, to be evicted from their homes when the building is demolished to make way for a new developement project.  We meet several charactes who live in the apartment complex, and they are all appealing, so you feel and care for their safety when the outbreak does occur, which you can see coming from the numerous television and radio broadcasts placed throughout the film.<br />  The movie is not perfect, though, because while I liked the idea of rats becoming infected and attacking people, I found it curious that while most of the victims became zombie-like flesh eaters, a few turned into those human/rat hybrids, with silly rat-like noses placed awkwardly on their faces.  A minor quibble, I guess, and luckily those hybrids don't take up too much screen time.  But otherwise I highly recommend the movie, if only for the setting itself.
Zombie flicks have flooded the market over the past several years and nearly each one released seems exactly the same as the last with the exception of a few.  Mulberry Street wouldn't be any different if it wasn't for a slight "twist".<br /><br />Instead of having a zombie apocalypse, the creators decided to make the undead flesh eating rat zombies.  Sound lame?  Well surprisingly enough it isn't.  The story is pretty basic, rat attacks have been escalating in the city followed by a fatal sickness with each victim bitten.  The source of the virus is never explained, aside from it being carried by rats.  This is nothing new for zombie flicks, they usually never explain the origin of the virus.  The film does a nice job of developing the characters it introduces and luckily since the acting is above par compared to many of the other After Dark films, you actually somewhat care about the characters fate.<br /><br />The gore isn't anything to write home about, it's what you'd expect from a movie like this.  The majority of it are shots of the rat people feeding on dead corpses.  The movies saving grace is that it's pretty intense with some genuinely creepy scares and how oddly disturbing some of the creatures look.  I found their look to be more frightening than any zombie I've seen in a film (with the exception of the final scene of Rec).  Overall I'd have to recommend this movie to horror fans.  In's one of the better After Dark Horror Fest films and would stand pretty good on it's own right.
How the movie was shot, it made the plot work, didnt really know what to think with people being infected by rats, but it works.  There was one scene where a guy punches a ...........rat zombie?  in the head and caves its skull, it really didnt fit in the movie, I didnt like that.  It was obvious that they did their casting in New York, which made the acting in the movie more authentic. Its a Good Pick!!
They could have used any infection and gotten the same result, rats seemed like a cop-out for me. The story seemed to be like Dawn of the Dead if it had been crammed into a single night. Also, are we to believe that in the entire city, only 2-3 people owned a gun? The characters that were enjoyable were killed off or never got enough screen time, and the ending left off in an allusion like we were supposed to feel something, but there was nothing to feel.While entertaining for the first watch, theres no urge to watch it again, except in the background during a party on Halloween night.
such a bad movie. i can't believe how many good reviews this film has received. first of all, a good horror movies either has good gore/story or both. mulberry street has neither. horror fans want to see some blood. nothing really happens in the first 40 minutes or so, the audiece is painfully forced to watch the comings and goings of a group of people. there is no charater development at all. if the write and director wants a good story, then they must have good character develoment so the audience can relate to them. these pathetic character have nothing to do with the plot. and when the reall horror begins, there is nothing scary or even remotely original. in fact, i hate these charaters so much, and i cannot wait to see them being attacked and eaten. the apocalpse/zombie story has been done countless times, but others do a much better job. this film makes me angry. avoid it
The tenants of a condemned apartment complex are left to fight for their lives when plague-bearing rats begin infecting the neighbors, turning them into mutant zombie were-rats that quickly consume the entire island of Manhattan! MULBERRY STREET is easily one of the best independent Horror entries acquired by the After Dark Horrorfest series. It manages to create a huge look and feel on a tiny scale. What makes the film so effective is its emphasis on character, establishing flawed, raw, but genuine personas that carry the plot through its slow build. Jim Mickle also utilizes the crude look of the digital photography along with putrid color filters and dilapidated sets to give the impression of a devastating citywide epidemic much to the same extent that Danny Boyle had done in 28 DAYS LATER. The film also cleverly injects a biting injunction against urban renewal when it comes at the cost of ruining people's lives and destroying their homes. MULBERRY STREET is not a perfect film, but it does show a great deal of promise and is far above average compared to most other low budget Horror entries.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
You know how Toho Production makes a bunch of Godzilla films and then as public interest peters out, they decide to go on hiatus for half a decade or more? I really wish this same thing would happen with character driven zombie films.<br /><br />Mulberry Street is one of those. An epidemic in New York turns everyone rabid and the close-knit residents of an apartment complex join together to hole up and fight it off. The characters were great, the father reuniting with his daughter finally coming home after being injured in the army, the old best friend who have lived in their apartment for 50 years, and all the peripherals were done wonderfully. The acting was definitely impressive. I have to admit I was convinced.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I've been convinced before. Lots of times. The locales, the characters, the subplots, the start of the epidemic all have changed, but the core has not. And frankly, I'm feeling the genre was already bursting at the seams of over-saturation a few years back. Granted, there have been a films have been the exception by squeaking in with a fantastic twist or hook or just absolutely stellar comedy, but this hasn't done it.<br /><br />And speaking of comedy, I couldn't help wondering why this wasn't one. New York gets invaded by RAT PEOPLE. At first contamination, the people still look somewhat human but by the end of the film all the RAT PEOPLE look like a bunch of rodent versions of Count Orloks from Nosferatu with their long noses and hungry eyes. I can't imagine why this movie was played straight. With the characters and subplots written convincingly enough, and the fact that they strayed from inserting typical virus-spawned zombies, I believe the writers could have delivered on some truly golden comedy.<br /><br />Instead, I'm left watching goofy, crazy rat people plod around, attacking people like zombies have always attacked people (albeit with a couple of instances of crawling through walls), filmed like zombies attacking people has always been filmed, paced like every film of zombies attacking people has ever been paced, and leaving me just plain bored.<br /><br />I see that Director/Co-Writer Jim Mickle has a new film coming out this year called Stake Land and Mulberry Street certainly gave me enough to have interest in catching this one, but it didn't give me enough interest in itself, sadly.<br /><br />I suppose if you've managed to never see a character driven zombie film, it's a pretty good one. But if you've already seen a few or, like me, well more than your fair share, it's a little bit too late in the game and its new addition of rat people would be better suited to a comedy.<br /><br />I was really feeling 2 1/2 stars on this one, but since it really wouldn't be a bad place to start getting into this kind of film I swayed towards 3. I'm just not going to recommend it to any of my fellow zombie movie gluttons--unless after all the zombie films you've seen you've always imagined a movie where Count Orlok splices his genes with a rat, clones himself, and invades New York...and that you've always imagined this movie being played dead straight without any camp value to be found.
low budget entry in the AFTER DARK HORRORFEST gets credit for its avoidance of stereotypical characters and effective camera work to compensate for its low budget.  its cast of unknowns is very effective and the sense of doom is disturbing.  its not your typical zombie flick and is above average, albeit a little bleak in its ending.
The story here is a little flimsy, and at times the "rat/people/zombies" looked kinda silly, but overall I very much enjoyed this one. The cast was very "average joe", like you could run into any of these people on the street.  This lent a realism to the film that so many other movies lack.  I also enjoyed the cinematography quite a bit.  Instead of making everything too dark as so many horror films do, instead we get our heroes fleeing to a rooftop in a washed out shade of blue, while the government haz mat team is filmed in bright yellow and orange ascending the stairs. Doesn't sound like much but little touches like that made the film visually interesting to watch.  Another example is a very brief shot of what looks like two yellow lights on the street, then one turns to red and the viewer realizes the second yellow light is actually the moon.  Nice touch.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00127RAHQ">Mulberry Street</a> really caught me off guard.  Given the limited budget, they made several good decisions with this movie.  They clearly avoided casting the biggest names they could, and instead cast actors who were good for their roles.  And they also developed the characters in the story before unleashing the horror element on them, an epidemic of diseased rats that overtake New York City.  So despite a story that is difficult to sell, this movie comes out looking better than most ADHF features have.<br /><br />A better title would have helped to make the movie more sellable.  In this case, they are selling the city. It's not clear why they chose Mulberry Street over Lafayette or any number of New York city streets.  Still it's a relatively minor point.<br /><br />The movie also does a good job of blending enjoyable horror in with the human interest stories and possibly deeper layers of meaning.  We care about the characters as we watch things unfold.  It's enough to allow us to ignore the other silly aspect to the movie, which is the effects of being bitten by the rats on the appearance of the infected.  Granted, there are a lot of "zombie / infection" movies, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN80">28 Weeks Later</a>.  Like most good zombie film, the infection is a part of the story and does not overtake character development or plot structure.<br /><br />The plot lines of the various characters do overlap and intersect somewhat.  Once again, this movie clearly operated on a tight budget.  But they deserve credit for at least producing a watchable feature.  That's more than many big budget horror movies can say for themselves.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Despite the cheeky story, this is an entertaining movie that is interesting and fun to watch. For me this is a 3, but I can definitely see an argument for a 4.  But whether it's a three star or a four star movie, it's worth renting at least once.  If you've ever seen rats run across the subway track, you will find this story very believable.<br /><br />Enjoy.
I just munch this type of movie up but i was still left wanting something else to eat. The movie seemed to take forever as far as getting something going here. Once it did, it was hard to make scenes out due to the darkness in the film and the acting was just ok but for some reason, I just could not give it a two star. The movie did have its scary moments and i am glad i did purchase the DVD at a cheap rate.
"Mulberry Street" was one of those films that I feel sat on the brink of being a really good movie, but no one gave it a push to send it over.  I thought the idea of rats passing on the virus or whatever to humans who then became more and more rat-like and cannibalistic was really clever.  It's too bad that the movie took that idea and ran away from it instead of with it.<br /><br />The acting was decent.  You managed to have the opportunity to get to know the main characters well enough to care (or not care) about them as the film progressed.  I enjoyed the idea of the man who was loved by all but basically kept his thoughts and feelings to himself.  I liked the idea of the gay male who was so friendly to everyone.  I even liked the idea of the daughter coming home to hell after her tour of duty.  But, then, like a bolt of lightning, everything burned at the end.  I managed to hang in there to the bitter end thinking, "Okay, here is where it all comes together.  Here is where Daddy saves his daughter at the expense of everything."  And, was I disappointed?  Heck yeah!  They really screwed up a perfectly mediocre movie that was almost worth watching with a 2 minute ending that an eight-year-old could've done better.<br />If you don't mind all of that and can dig really hard for potential, it's worth watching; otherwise, watch it on someone else's dime.
Well, after my appalling experience with Camp Death earlier today, I can't believe I actually found a really good horror movie!  I was very pleasantly surprised by this one, and I have Mr. Enriquez' review to thank for it! So, thanks!<br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed this one, and actually wish I'd bought instead of renting it. The actors are believable, the plot was fairly original, and the camera work was steady. I'd recommend this one for any horror fan who finds even reasonably good new movies hard to come by.
this movie is the worst movie in the 07 set and i would not buy this movie maybe rent it if you just have to see it
I can handle a B-movie horror flick, own 100's of them. this is the absolute worst of the series!
I bought this almost a year ago at Wal-mart because the front cover says: "A Zombie film that breaks the mold." It started off okay, then you find out that the epidemic is spread through rats. So, when people become zombies, they also look like rat people. So, yeah, don't watch nor buy it!  I would not recommend MULBERRY STREET!!!
This was another waste of $14+.  The acting was fair, but the story was weak and disjointed.  This is yet another in a long line of failures in the "AfterDark Horrorfest."  If you absolutely MUST watch this DVD, rent it.  Don't buy it.  Really.  It's not worth keeping.
8 films to die for i was a lil dissappointed with this one rats umm i dunno what to say rent this one it was ok not great and not terrible worthy to rent red box!!
Based on the reviews here and on imdb, I was expecting a lot more. I can only imagine that the reviewers are not horror afficionados and so their ability to be startled and scared are somewhat lower than your usual horror fan.<br />The first problem with "Mulberry Street" is that it takes much too long to start. Too much background information that could've been inserted during breaks in the action and very slow progression of incidents leading to the fun of Act 2. And as for the action and suspense, the director fails to provide any real thrills and chills with the shaky camera movment just becoming annoying after awhile. With films like "30 Days of  Night," "28 Weeks Later," and the Resident Evil series bringing the "mankind vs. the maddening hoards" premise to new and more interesting levels, "Mulberry Street," fails to bring anything new or interesting to the genre. Besides this, the somewhat double ending was odd and unsatisfying leaving me and other viewers to wonder if the two male leads had a relationship.<br />While not terribly awful, nor as bad as some of the Sci-Fi Channel fare, you'll wish you had spent your time otherwise instead of wasting it on "Mulberry Street."
I was in the video store today looking for a good horror movie. My mom suggested Mulberry Street. On the front it said, "A Zombie film that breaks the mold." I like Zombie movies and I happen to like a FEW of the After Dark Horror Fest Movies. So as I'm sitting here watching it, I start falling asleep. It start's off very slow and picks up about half way in the middle of the movie. It has NOTHING to do with Zombies what so ever. So people are bitten by rats and become rat people not zombies. What a waste of money but I'm happy that I didn't buy this [...]. If you like stupid horror movies then watch it [I happen to love cheesy horror movies but this was [...]] other wise, don't waste your time.
Last year's initial offerings of the After Dark Horrorfest films were surprisingly good.  There were no classics in the group but neither were there any real duds either (Although The Hamiton's came close).  The films were consistently well made considering the budget constraints they were under.  With that in mind, the anticipation for this year's films was quite high.  Unfortunately, things don't get off to a very strong start with Mulberry St., a ridiculous creature feature that is about fifty years too late.<br /><br />Most of the action takes place in a New York apartment building with a diverse group of tenants including former boxer Clutch, androgynous Coco, single mom Kay and her teenage son, and some assorted old coots.  For reasons which are never explained and barely even touched on, rats in the subway begin attacking and biting people.  We're never shown these attacks, we hear about them only through TV and radio news reports and thus, it's impossible to grasp just what kind of scale we are talking about.  Is it dozens of rats?  Hundreds?  Thousands?  This part of the city is locked down to try and contain the virus spread by the rats, a virus which turns the victim into, for lack of a better term, were-rats.<br /><br />Now if the virus had simply turned the people rabid and crazed with a taste for blood, it could have worked.  But no, the virus actually turns them into human rats with pointy ears and noses, long sharp teeth, and whiskers.  The make-up was so bad that the actors looked like rejects from the Broadway play of Cats.  It was unintentionally funny.  There is no logic to the plot.  What caused the rats to start attacking?  What caused people bitten to turn into rats?  And what was done to prevent further outbreaks?  All of these questions are left unanswered.<br /><br />The rat-people converge on the neighborhood including the apartment building, crawling between the walls and ceilings to attack the residents who think they are safe behind closed doors.  The performances weren't terrible and you have to laud the actors for at least going along with the awful plot and giving it their best.  Kim Blair manages to stand out as Clutch's daughter Casey, a solider returning home from the Middle East just as the outbreak begins.<br /><br />There's nothing terrifying in Mulberry St., and there's no suspense.  The rat-people were unconvincing as a threat, and the story is filled with crater-like divots.<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />Mulberry St. does come with a number of extras should you really want to see them.<br /><br />"Behind the Scenes: The Rats" featurette is a piece about the making of the film.<br />There's also short bits on the film's make and FX, deleted scenes, and Outtakes.<br /><br />Tim Janson and Robert Trate will be bringing all 8 Films to Die For to Mania.

This Movie Was Awful!Its like a remake of the graveyard shift. I was not scared one bit total BS! Do not buy this unless Rats scare you.
the other reviewers gave away the story so these people did see the movie, ratings are unbelievable. system wont allow zero stars. this is pure garbage. slowly builds to the most stupid zombie type plot. 28 days-ish but for a kindergarten film class.
