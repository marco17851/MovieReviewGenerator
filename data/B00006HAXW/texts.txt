Over the past few years, public television has put on a series of vintage &quot;Doo Wop&quot;  and Rock 'N' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless.  This latest dvd &quot;Rock, Rhythm And &quot;Doo Wop&quot;, is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist's with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who's who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quot;Keep-A Rockin&quot;, and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it's feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50's and 60's, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies.
I recvd this video (DVD version) as a Christmas gift.  I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning.  It's the best "Oldies" video I've ever seen.  It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60's, and they're still great - Jay and the Americans, Lou Christie, The Five Satins, Little Richard, Kathy Young, Little Anthony, The Fleetwoods, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts.  These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing, and it all shows.  It's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh, PA, and distributed around the country to donors.  They mention that this was the third concert, and I want ALL of them.  Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced.  The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect, and truly celebrates their works. The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews.
Wow! When I saw this show on PBS--that was it, I had to have this!  What great tunes!  And seeing these groups--terrific! I couldn't find a list of songs, so here's some of them: Keep-a-Knockin--Little Richard; Sea Cruise--Frankie Ford; A Thousand Stars--Kathi Young (still cute!) and the Innocents; Silhouettes by the Rays; Do You Love Me--The Contours; Have You Heard--The Duprees; over 40 songs in all, including Little Anthony, The Five Satins, Lloyd Price, The Skyliners, The Fleetwoods, Jay &amp; the Americans (This Magic Moment, Cara Mia and Come a Little Bit Closer!); Lou Christie; plus Franki Valli and Jerry Butler as hosts. Plus interviews with Kathi Young, Lou Christie and the producer TJ Lubinski (thanks TJ!)
I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs, and was anxiously waiting for Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive. From the first video, which featured the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the 50s groups, to Doo Wop 51, it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production. Better lighting, better stage layout, and better sound quality.<br />Sadly, in terms of editing, they went overboard this time. Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me. There are times where you can hardly hear the singing, because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud. Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater. It's simply too artificial. We want not only the authentic groups, but also the authentic reaction from who was there. And believe me, we don't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups.<br />For whoever edited the show, I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups.<br />Is this DVD worth buying? Definately, because groups/singers Fred Parris &amp; The Satins, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, Little Richard, The Limelites, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Bobby Lewis, and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile.<br />I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this, they're a wonderful experience for all ages.
Having worked in television for 34 years I can tell you that this is one of the finest doo-wop DVD's you will ever see. It is done with class and a great respect for the talent. Congratulations to T.J. Lubinsky the producer. Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today. the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on &quot;Two Kinds of People In The World&quot; is worth the price alone. I have played this piece over and over. All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through.
The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all! It is just great! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there. After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51. What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past! You will never regret buying this DVD.
I have all of the doo wop DVD's and this one is as good or better than the 1st ones. Remember once these performers are gone, we'll never get to see them again. Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you'll LOVE this DVD !!
The performance of Little Anthony and the Imperials singing &quot;Two Kinds of People&quot; acappella is worth the price of admission; they haven't lost a step!  The rest is simply gravy.
Get it, also get Dop Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51. Each performances is like the original 45's, except with modern, nice ,crisp sound like today's cds.
Excellent, excellent performers.  Excellent video and audio quality.  Buy this DVD and go back in time.  Well worth the time waiting for almost a year to get hold of the DVD.
This video is awesome and of particular interest to anyone who grew up with the great music of the 50's and 60's.  The Duprees were wonderful!  Also, Jay Black's Cara Mia gave me goose bumps.  It doesn't matter how old these guys are, they can still belt out quite a song.  Little Anthony and the Imperials were also very, very good!  They have recaputured the sounds of the music they way we remembered it!  The backup musicians deserve an huge amount of praise. This is one you do not want to miss!  I recommend it HIGHLY!
As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I thought Little Richard's appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford's Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of "Two Kinds of People in the World", and Jay Black and the Americans' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn't get a performance of their own, because they are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD library.  Some notes here:  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers.  There are five or six on Doo Wop 50, ten on Doo Wop 51, and ten or twelve on this one, but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances, of which there are four.  There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case, but whoever designed that put them in random order, not as they appear on the DVD.  The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows:<br /><br />Keep A Knocking - Little Richard<br />Sea Cruise - Frankie Ford<br />A Thousand Stars - Kathy Young and the Innocents<br />Silhouettes - The Rays<br />Do You Love Me - Contours<br />Have You Heard and You Belong to Me - Duprees<br />Peppermint Twist - Joey Dee and the Starlighters<br />For Your Love - Ed Townsend<br />Romeo and Juliet - Reflections<br />Lightning Strikes - Lou Christie<br />Tears on My Pillow, Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop, Two Kins of People in the World, Hurt So Bad, and Going Out of My Head - Little Anthony & the Imperials<br />Since I Fell for You - Lenny Welch<br />Tossing and Turning - Bobby Lewis<br />Mr. Blue and Come Softly to Me - Fleetwoods<br />Remember Then and I Believe - Larry Chance and the Earls<br />Daddy's Home - Shep and the Limelighters<br />This Magic Moment and Cara Mia - Jay Black and the Americans<br />He Don't Love You (Like I Love You) - Jerry Butler and Pure Gold<br />Stagger Lee - Lloyd Price<br />Once in a While -  Chimes<br />Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye - Casinos<br />To the Aisle and In the Still of the Night - Fred Parris and the Satins<br />Let's Hang On - Frankie Valli and cast (end credits)<br />Bonus tracks (can be viewed in any order):<br />Never - Earls<br />My Own True Love -  Duprees<br />Come a Little Bit Closer - Jay Black and the Americans<br />First I Look at the Purse - Contours.
I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this program, and I second everything the other reviewer wrote.  I used most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it.  We first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from CD's and then watched the DVD.  They enjoyed it so much I ordered a DVD copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class.  I would suggest ordering the DVD version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that aren't available on the VHS version.  The DVD version is now available only from PBS.  The singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits, but they can still sing them as well as ever.  My only complaint with it is it has five songs by Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place.  Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with either the VHS or DVD version.  I prefer the DVD since it includes extra songs and interviews that the VHS version doesn't have.
