This movie was amazing. I watched an interview dvd with the doors prior to it, and this was taken exactly from what they said. Every inch of this movie was from the mouths of the real people, so accurate and he really looks like jim alot in this.
Thanks to the unbelieveably meticulous direction from Oliver Stone and the hypnotic sublime performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, The Doors is an undeniable masterpiece of film. The late 60's and early 70's era is re-created brilliantly as we see the rise of a young Morrison who went from a poet to being the frontman of one of the defining bands of the century. Kilmer's performance must be seen to be believed (he looks, moves, and sounds exactly like the late Lizard King), and he is clearly the most underrated actor of his generation. An all star cast is brought together with Frank Whaley (Pulp Fiction) as Robby Kreiger, Kyle MacLachlan (Blue Velvet) as Ray Manzarek, Kevin Dillon (The Blob) as John Densmore, and Meg Ryan as Jim's long time girlfriend Pam. The rest of the ensemble cast includes Michael Madsen, Michael Wincott, Billy Idol, and Kathleen Quinlan. All in all, this is one of the definitive films of the 90's, and is a must own for fans of The Doors or Kilmer alike.
Somewhere in the beginning of the movie, Ray Manzarek, keyboard player for the Doors, says to Jim Morrison that "we've gotta make the myths".  If Morrison by the end of his life wasn't a myth already, he sure is now, thanks to Oliver Stone's take on his short but shall we say intense life.<p>As always, there's been a lot of controversy about Stone's historical inventions (cfr. JFK and Nixon), but then I don't think that reality was really the point anyway. What Stone pulled off here was to make a movie out of the music of The Doors, using its sensibilities and surreal images. Morrison's life is just the thread that runs through it all, and where the facts are given a wide berth, atmosphere takes over. Boy, does it ever - I think that watching The Doors is about as close as you can get to experiencing an acid trip without actually taking LSD. It's visually kinetic and obviously there's all of that music - 135 minutes worth of it. Don't watch it to get to know Jim Morrison; watch it to understand the music and the era from which it came. And watch it to see Val Kilmer's uncanny portrayel of Morrison, arguably one of the finest acting jobs ever done based on a real person.<p>DVD treatment is fine, with a crystal clear transfer of the movie - just too bad it wasn't enhanced for 16:9 tv's. Extra's include a surprisingly honest making-of, The Road Of Excess, director's commentary with Oliver Stone still thinking himself a genius (hey, watcha gonna do?) and 43 minutes worth of deleted scenes - most of which deserved their fate.
I might be the perfect audience for this movie.  I like the Doors music, but I haven't read any of the books about them.  I'm hot and cold on the excesses of Oliver Stone's film style, but it seemed to work in this case.  I don't know what is truth and what is fiction, but the style of the film blended into the music made for an entertaining experience.  In many ways the movie opened up their lesser-known songs to my enjoyment and the performances in the film are excellent.  Being somewhat tired of Meg Ryan's Romantic Comedy per year output, it was nice seeing what might happen to such a sweet girl in the throes of the 60s, Rock music and the decadent scene.  You also have to wonder why Val Kilmer wasn't nominated for an Oscar after his great performance.  What's interesting about hippie movies is that film makers inevitably identify with this period and have to contain themselves not to romanticize it, but I still come away glad that I wasn't a part of it.  <p>As for the Special Edition DVD, Oliver Stone provides insightful commentary about the making of the film and the meeting of Jim's and Pam's parents.  He points out and explains the symbolism of the Shaman and death and all of the things that seem in your face on first viewing.  I have always thought that Stone is a top-notch filmmaker mired in his own fascination with the 60s.  But you have to give the guy credit for movies like this.  No one anywhere could have made a big budget movie about The Doors except for Oliver Stone.
this video is a must have for anyone who enjoys the doors. Val Kilmner's portrayal of Jim Morrison is the best thing that he has ever done. you will swear that he is posessed by the spirit of Morrison. Meg Ryan as Pam completes this tale of late 60's drug crazed rock and roll. Get it you won't regret it.
This is a great movie. If you like the doors or EVEN if you dont like the doors it's still great. It has a lot of the doors songs on the movie and  also great TRUE facts although some are false. If you haven't seen this  movie I advise you to.
Last night's bargain-rack movie was "The Doors," a film by Oliver Stone. If you enjoy rock 'n' roll and the life-style that seems to be associated with it, then you might enjoy this film. The Doors were a rock group whose leader, Jim Morrison, was a beach dude from Venice, California, and who's personal theme song was "The World Owes Me A Living." Jim met up with another Venice beach person who liked his poetry and first thing you know a couple other guys joined and they put together a band which quickly became popular. It was on to Whiskey A Go-Go, a Los Angeles dive for up and coming bands, then on to San Francisco, a recording contract and off to New York City, all in a very short time span. Burning the candle at both ends became a way of life. The Doors fame quickly grew and their records hit big-time and the funding rolled in. Jim Morrison's ego quickly inflated to mega-proportions and he began to hold everyone in contempt, his venue owners, the police, his loyal girlfriend, his band-mates and, ultimately, even his fans, while he proclaimed that life wasn't worth living and that he wanted to die. His intake of intoxicants was prodigious and he favored hard booze, guzzled straight from the bottle. His shows gradually became intoxicated brawls until, finally, he died of heart problems at the old age of 29. Okay, I've glossed it over a bit but that's the general gist. It's an interesting story and the general outline fits more than one rock group.<br /><br />The movie was quite excellent. Well done! The acting was believable. You could actually feel as if you're a member of the entourage and are going through this ridiculous rise and fall right along with Morrison and the band. Most of the Doors songs have faded with 60s memories, but it's good hearing them again in the context of the times.. The Doors have become music critics legendary darlings so a lot of interesting extra materials are included on a second disc. It's a worthwhile DVD packet, whether you liked the Doors or not.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
Val Kilmer, who plays Jim Morrison of THE DOORS plays the part that was designed, and created for Val and only Val to play! No other actor on Earth could portray this musician, James Morrison.<br />Jim Morrison was the rock of cock, he was the poet the man who knew how the right type of drugs could enduce his mental mind to the point that no other rock star on Earth can or has done since his time.<br /><br />However, Jim was also a spoiled rotton egotistical greedy self centered punk who centered only upon himself. His fame was his death. He thought he was above it all. His drug and alchohol abuse killed him. He mentally killed his only love that loved him through thick and thin, Pam. His beloved. He had an affair with this woman who is a wanna be witch in real life and who in real life is nothing but the tramp that ruined Pam and Jim. He whored on Pam and Pam turned to Herione.<br /><br />Watch this true movie. Watch what I see.<br /><br />See if you see what I watched.
This film does more than scratch the surface regarding the band The Doors. However, it is far from comprehensive. The fact that some fiction was applied to the film was a bit disappointing. The heavy focus on Jim Morrison caused the other band members to be distant. It is essential viewing for any true Doors fan, but I have found books on this subject to be more informative. The film is reasonably entertaining, and the special edition interviews are good viewing.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
This movie is really great. Val Kilmer deserves am award for his portrail of Jim Morrison. All the actors that played the Doors were awesome because Val really sang and the other guys really played their instruments. If you love the Doors and Jim Morrison then you will really love this movie. Also with the help of the remaining Doors Oliver Stone made this movie true to life and according to the facts.
The Doors. I don't very much understand this movie. Not for the story but I am unsure where Oliver Stone was coming from with this take on the life and death of Jim Morrison. Did Stone have an axe to grind? It seemed that way. I have read several books and watched footage of him as well as interviews with those closest to him. Yes, Morrison did have issues with alcohol that at times rendered him ( I am sure) unbearable and obnoxious but it seems this is all we ever see. The character is very one dimensional. Val Kilmer has the look and feel of Morrison down pat. Unfortunately, he had to follow Stone's portrayal which is where the problem is. There was another side that Stone neglects entirely. Morrison in interviews tended to be very soft spoken, shy. We never see this side as it is thrown aside to have the arrogant Morrison 24/7 stoned and /or drunk staggering around spouting lines from songs that were still unwritten and at times written by other band members. Morrison was a talented poet and troubled person with his own demons; however we never get to see this in favor of flamboyant and at times inaccurate depictions.<br />There are some pros to this movie. Some of the cinematography is beautiful, and Kilmer did a great job of sounding like the real Jim Morrison. The music and the feel is pure 60's heaven. I would like to have been around then to see a glimpse.<br />The movie has its' merits, but most will walk away for an utter dislike for Morrison which is based on a lot of falsehoods..
This hasn't aged well since I first saw it in like 1997 in high school. Oliver Stone directs this power film starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, front man singer for rock group The Doors. The main thing here is the rock star excess of jim Morrison played well by Kilmer. The rest of the band takes a back sit in this cool chiller about Jim Morrison who rocked the late 60s and early 70s. The Doors' music is no longer shocking after living through the rise of black metal and the punk revival. I would recommend it to anyone, though a masterpiece it's not any more. I still enjoy Doors' music reissues on CD.
what can i say, a classic movie about a classic rock band on high def blue ray.....get it.
This is the best rock movie ever made. Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time. This is a film he gets less credit for, but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done. First of all, he nails the life of Jim Morrison, the story of The Doors, and the L.A. Scene (1960s) as perfectly as it can be done. It is beyond nostalgoia, it is time travel.<br />As great as Stone's use of Doors songs, scenery, drug use and beautiful, heavily-decorated '60s California girls is, it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest. Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks.<br />Next on the agenda, you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on, irritating Ray Manzarek. To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors, everything is flawless. The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene, particularly Morrison urinating at Barney's Beanery, which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe.<br />The feeling watching "The Doors" switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led, and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it.<br />Love my girl!
Great music, great concert camera work, and great acting by Val Kilmer.<br />The only real negative is the focus on Lizard King persona, and not<br />enough real Jim. But overall worth watching w/ the volume set on high.
This was the part that Val Kilmer was born to play. The music in the movie just makes you trip away from the very beginning. It's fantastic. I love the Doors. This is a must have for any Door's fan.
Great movie and performances from all.  Not sure why he didn't get a nomination.. must have to any collection
This is a great quality product and quick shipping. The movie is great depicting the era of the great rock n roll bands. This type of musical talent no longer exists in "today's" bands.
This was a wonderful film, ValKilmer's best in my opinion. As Jim Morrison Kilmer gets to the core of the inner and oft hidden demons with all of us.<br /><br />Although achieving wealth,fame and success Morrisson is haunted by a mystical figure who appears to be calling him toward his destiny a destiny which Jim seems so eager to meet and embrace.<br /><br />Morrison personifies all that was rock and roll in the 60's , sex drugs and seeminly a taste for pushing ones'self to the limits of physical and psychological exhausion.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.
you love oliver stone or hate 'em but for this viewer The Doors defines rock music in the 60s better than any other movie. it's a stone trademark to get career-defining performances from people and in this case Val Kilmer gives one of the best performances of his career. Kilmer's transformation into Jim Morrison is uncanny. The music is used artfully and the editing is fantastic. The only false note is the casting of meg ryan as Morrison's wife. Otherwise a beautiful immersive movie.
Formed by Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek at a night on the beach after Jim read some of his poems to Ray, The Doors became one of the greatest rock bands of all time in the late 60s. Jim Morrison was one of the first rock n roll rebels and wrote some of the darkest, deepest songs ever ("The End", "Strange Days", etc.) Even Iggy and the Stooges and the MC5 started a band themselves after being mesmerized at a Doors concert. The band started in 1965, and released their first album in 1967, and sadly the original band ended in 1971, due to Jim Morrison's unfortunate death.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's film is more about Jim Morrison than the band, to be honest. Val Kilmer's performance is so convincing, you'd think you're watching Jim in the film (and in some shots, you are!). It has been said that even the surviving Doors members had trouble distinguishing Kilmer's vocals from Morrison's own. Val Kilmer should've at least been nominated for an oscar. The actors playing the other Doors members (Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillion, and Frank Whaley) have some screen time, but as I said, the movie is basically about Jim. I think this is an excellent bio-pic, but some would disagree. So, check it out if you're a fan, or even if you aren't a fan. It's a masterpiece. Oh, and Oliver Stone is an admitted fanatic Morrison fan, in interviews he has said that he views him as something of a god.
When I saw "The Doors : Special Edition" I hoped that Oliver Stone would have added additional footage into the movie that was originally taken out for time.  That wasn't the case.  The film remains as it has since it's release, and the only addition is a second DVD included with "The Road of Excess" documentary, a small featurette and interviews with some of the cast, and of course, Oliver Stone himself.<br /><br />While the extra DVD does shed some additional light on the film, I don't believe it adds anything of significance to the original film Oliver Stone presented in 1991.  I gave it 4 stars because of the film itself, the bonus DVD deserves 2 stars.
If you love The Doors, you need to watch this film. It's absolutely amazing. Full of many songs from The Doors and other bands of the era, it paints a picture of the band from the very beginning until Morrison's death. Val Kilmer gives an outstanding performance and slips into the role of Jim Morrison with no problems. You're tempted to think it IS Morrison. Meg Ryan is wonderful as Pamela Morrison.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of The Doors. I can't get enough of it.
In 1991 director Oliver Stone made two epics concerning the 1960s, "JFK" and "The Doors".  In my humble opinion, Stone was most successful with "The Doors" in evoking the spirit of that tumultuous time in American history.  You can feel and taste the ambiance of the Sunset Strip and the smoky clubs that the Doors used as their stomping grounds.  But who's kidding who; the Doors were a vehicle for the musings of their charasmatic leader, Jim Morrison, and the rest of the band were able sidemen.  Val Kilmer so eerily channels the spirit of Morrison in his performance here that you feel that you are actually witnessing the rise and downward spiral of the Lizard King himself.  The cast here includes many talented individuals(Meg Ryan, Kyle Maclachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon) but essentially they are but straight men to the Morrison show.  The reason I rate this film four stars instead of five is indicative of the fact that this is ultimately not an easy film to watch.  It's something of a chore to witness the self-destruction of a talented individual through his own narcissistic indulgences.
The doors is a fantastic film about the great 60's rock band "the Doors" and front man Jim Morrison. This film talks about how the band got started and how it ended. Val Kilmer deserved an oscar out of this film. He looked, sounds, and acted like Jim Morrison. Oliver Stone made a perfect choice casting Val. I've never really heard any of the doors music, but this film (like sid and nancy) got me in to them. This film realy catches the scent of the 60's. Peace, love, naked, marijuana, and etc. This film can be depressing watching it but is realy amazing. It can be funny also at the same time, who knew Jim was funny.<br /><br />The second disk includes a featurette, trailer-teaser-tv spots, deleted scenes, road to excess-a deep and dark look at the heart of the film, comentary, and much more. The only thing that disapointed me buy buying this film is that there are no subtitles. Some scenes are really hard to understand. Other than that you need to go pick up this dvd. You wont be disapointed except for the subtitle draw back.
I have the Stone Complete Boxed Set (full set) - and this movie is not anamorphic or even what they call "enhanced for 16x9" TVs.  So when you play it, bars not only appear on the top and bottom (not as a big deal) - but they do on the sides as well (this is BAD)...so you have to zoom it to fill out the 16 x 9 TVs.<br /><br />Supposedly the 2DVD Doors special edition that came out in 1997 (orange) - said it was anamorphic this time, but is it true this was not really the case as everyone found out?<br /><br />And so - does anyone know if this new edition (purple) is truly amamorphic or enhanced for 16x9 TVs.  I know it isn't HD, but anamorphic...you know what I mean?<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br />UPDATE for FEBRUARY 20th!!! - it IS TRUE ANAMORPHIC!!!  Thanks!!!
is what this movie should have been titled.  Jim Morrison appears drunk and high in 99.9% of the scenes in this movie which I found dissapointing.  Val Kilmer does a GREAT job as the Doors frontman.  Maybe it's because I grew up in the late 70's, but I didn't really understand Oliver Stone's need to show us what it's like to be on acid and all the while reciting weirdo poetry like Morrison does in this movie...I mean, what's with the indians, snakes, etc? I would have prefered a straight story on the band, this movie is about Jim Morrison.  It's an interesting and different movie that's for sure.  The dvd menus are cool...like something from the 1960's.
Looks brand new, not a scratch on the DVD. One of my favorite movies so it was totally worth the $3!!!
Being a huge Doors fan it was entertaining. Oliver Stone did a great job with the scene feel. Val Kilmer did a phenomonal job as Jim, even satisfactorily vocaling some of the live concerts. If you have read some of  the books about Jim, ie. No One Here Gets Out Alive, you have noticed they  did not show the artist side of him as he was in real life. They show more  of the depression and self destruction. Also, Patricia Keneley was two  people combined into one character. Even so this is a great film of the  rise and fall of James Douglas Morrison.
Jim Morrison was a self-indulgent hack of a songwriter, but he was a man with charisma to spare.  It sometimes amazes he that his shoddy mythologizing passes for poetic expression, but then I listen to his voice:  Not technically beautiful, but lusty, ringing, and enormous, it redeems  some of his missteps and makes them into great rock songs like &quot;Break  on Through&quot; and &quot;LA Woman&quot;.  Oliver Stone, on the other  hand, is no hack, but like Morrison, he is overambitious and  self-indulgent.  It makes sense that he would make a film about the Doors'  frontman.  The result is an enormous film that is very nearly derailed by  Stone's irritating mannerisms and bloated, overheated directing, but maybe  that's fitting: A bloated, overheated rock star deserves a bloated,  overheated biopic.  The best part about the film by far is Val Kilmer's  mezmerizing performance as the Lizard King himself, and man is it a great  part--to me, it ranks with De Niro in &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; Washington  in &quot;Malcom X,&quot; and Brando in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; as one  of the finest of all time.  Unfortunately, Stone is unwilling to let his  star carry the picture and thereby outshine the director, and so the whole  enterprise comes this close to crashing down in flames.
Oliver Stone is a crazy nutbag and has gotten worse over time but Val Kilmer deserves major reconition for the best preformance he's ever given.
Having lived through the era in which this takes place, all I can say is WOW trippin' down memory lane!!!
Everyone has covered their views of Jim Morrison in more detail and length then his actual time in the limelight at this point. The Doors film is one of legendary proportions, often portraying the excessive more so then the intellectual elements that occurred. With so much coverage on Jim, as so with almost every Doors related book and article we'd think the DOORS MOVIE would maybe shed some light off the lizard king?<br /><br />No, this movie is strongly centric on Morrison. As a movie though it holds up, it's interesting and lengthy. As a portrayal it has hits and rapid fire misses. Trippy effects, surreal warmly euphoric moments, bizarre lighting it's all here.<br /><br />Unlike other movies there is no main underlying problem anyone sets out to fix, after all it's meant to be somewhat real right? Stone has fudged the truth to make possibly quick a buck or add the missing elements needed for a hit (like it wouldn't have been already). Jim Morrison was a funny, passionate, at times other worldly guy. While that is shown in brief amounts through speeches, we see his other capable side amplified. The side capable of inciting crowds, dangling off buildings to incite more people, and drinking heavily to incite the people around him. He was also a very deep thinker with a supposed IQ of 149, we find ourselves missing wondering where the other 49 went in this film. He's portrayed a sociopath with a drinking problem more so then the poet we've come to know him as.<br /><br />Aside from my little rant the movie is rather enjoyable. Good music is good music and the Doors had a wonderful catalog of music. A good movie is a good movie, it offers a colorful view on an era so hazily colored. When combined it works nicely, but the falsities are my underlying disapproval of anything greater then average toward this film. As a movie it holds its own, as a tribute to an amazing band it's a bit upsetting.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Quick run down:<br />Pros: Great renditions of a classic rock group, provides some uniquely odd scenes, insightful for quite a few Doors related things, impressive acting.<br /><br />Cons: Detaches from reality, endorses a destructive lifestyle without the conscious normal views of these people, some scenes grow boring due to length.
While the fans of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin wait endlessly for film bios of their Rock `n' Roll hero's Doors fans have long had the bio-pic of Jim Morrison courtesy of Oliver Stone.<br /><br />I gave this review four stars, but for the movie itself it's only three stars the fourth star is for the bonus features. The movie starts off well enough with Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison in a recording studio reading his poetry ("Did you have a good world when you died? Enough to base a movie on?") Then flashes back to Morrison's childhood when he witnessed an accident in the New Mexico desert in which some Indians had been in a car accident and the young Jim Morrison felt as if the soul of one of those Indians leapt into his. Then we pick up Morrison as leaves the UCLA film school to self imposed exile on a Venice Beach rooftop where it's inferred that Morrison was writing. He meets Pam Courson (Meg Ryan) and bumps into former UCLA classmate Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan) who asks Morrison what he's been doing, Morrison answers writing songs, and Manzarek asks him to sing one. Jim sings Moonlight Drive and Ray says they should start a rock band and make a million dollars.<br /><br />The movie closely follows the highlights of The Doors/Morrison's career from playing The Whisky a go-go where the Oedipal section of The End was first heard and got them fired only to be picked up by Elektra Records, to playing the Ed Sullivan Show and being asked by producers to excise the word higher in Light My Fire, Morrison refused, the New Haven concert where Morrison became the first rock star arrested on stage, Miami, his obscenity trial, his Wiccan wedding with Patricia Keneally (Kathleen Quinlan) and one unintentionally hilarious scene where Jim and Pam get into an argument and Jim stomps a duck. There are a lot of cameos in the movie including Doors drummer John Densmore, Billy Idol, Eric Burdon, Paul Williams, and Doors producer Paul Rothchild.<br /><br />The acting is good, although Michael Madsen seems wasted in such a small part of Tom Baker, a friend of Morrison's. Oliver Stone gets most of the facts right, and gives a good feel for the 60's and the music. What he doesn't get right is pretty major. Besides directing Stone also gets a credit as screenwriter, but when he runs out of things for Morrison to say he just inserts Doors lyrics, as if Morrison was running around quoting songs all the time. The movie also tends to only portray the sensationalistic side of Morrison's personality, and while I understand film is an active medium there is one scene missing, a scene which shows Morrison sitting and writing the songs.<br /><br />I gave one of the rating stars to the bonus features and this DVD is crammed with bonus features, deleted scenes, commentary, and the rarely seen English documentary The Doors Are Open which was shot on The Doors first European tour in 68.<br /><br />The Doors movie by Oliver Stone may be part of a 60's trilogy. Each third represents a different aspect of the 60's.<br /><br />Platoon-The Vietnam experience.<br />JFK- About the political atmosphere of the 60's and how we lost faith in our leaders because of an alleged conspiracy.<br /><br />And finally The Doors. To illustrate the counter culture experience of the 60's. This movie & JFK have both recieved reviews panning them due to not sticking with the facts. But these 2 movies are also outside of Stone's range of experience so it might have been a little harder for him to internalize the experience and present them to their best effect.
Wow, this is a very good movie.  Even if you consider yourself only somewhat of a Doors fan, you gotta admit this is one mighty fine movie.  The guy who plays the Jim Morrison character looks so much like him it's not even funny (and with the Doors, it's never a laughing matter).  You will learn so much about the band, and specifically Jim Morrison.  I like how he found his girlfriend in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />As for the Doors music, you will hear PLENTY of that throughout the movie.  A variety of songs throughout the first six studio albums, and even some surprising lesser known songs can be heard at times, such as "Love Street" and "Five to One".  I wasn't expecting to hear those songs.<br /><br />The story of how "Light my Fire" was created is a really good one too.  The constant drugs and drinking that Morrison did is all mentioned and detailed here as well.  Also, the part where the Doors weren't allowed to say "girl you couldn't get much higher" from the famous Ed Sullivan bit is included.  I like how Ed wanted the band to be happier and not so gloomy when they were sitting around in their dressing rooms and waiting to go out there and perform, haha.  We can look back and see the Doors simply didn't WANT to be the happy cheery type.<br /><br />I guess Jim Morrison was shy at first and didn't want to perform in front of big crowds, which explains why the first performance the Doors ever did, Jim had his back to the audience.  That was interesting.<br /><br />My favorite part is when Jim Morrison actually thought he wasn't a very good singer, and then he starts singing to the band members and... WOW.  Are you kidding me?  The guy is a BRILLIANT singer!<br /><br />Overall, this is great great stuff.
Highly entertaining film about the Doors rise to fame.  The music is great.  Not to be missed.
This film takes you through the history of the Doors starting in Vanice Beach California where they break through and rise to stardom.<br /><br />Perfectly cast Val Kilmar as Jim Morrison and his girlfriend Meg Ryan take you through the wild, ride of the life of Jim Morrison and his band.  Along with the evolving music of his band and the rising drug addiction that influenced the future of his life. It flows through the timeline showing all the true aspects of Jim's poetic personality.<br /><br />Fabulously portrayal of Jim Morrison and very entertaining.
Although I have never agreed with drug use at all, I have always enjoyed the music of Jim Morrison and the Doors. (and many other groups of the 60's and 70's)...<br />I also love the acting ability of Val Kilmer, and he is awesome in this role. The movie is very well made, the music is fantastic, the storyline is wonderful, yet so sad...<br />I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the Doors...
For those of us who grew up in the 1960s, this is a wonderful film.  It genuinely evokes the sense of newness and possibility of that time, that all old forms could be swept away, that we could live love and rock and not worry about the future.  Of course we were wrong, and those who embodied all the hope and excess, like Morrison, paid the price with their lives - they were drunk, drugged out, and many eventually died of it.<br /><br />Looking back on it, I feel amazed at how naive we were, how arrogant, but then, we were children and youths, affluent and feeling that the possibilities literally were limitless.  This film accurately portrays that feeling, both in its pathetic over-reaching, but also a lot of the beauty of it.<br /><br />This is the best Stone film by far, and I wasn't even into the Doors.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
Brilliant. The film starts out with The Doors, and then takes on a life of its own, becoming a cult object in the process, an objet  d'art, breathless, entwined, twirling, obsessive, relentless, varicoloured...It's like a sex act that feels unbearibly good and creates expectations of a final, musical, passionate, finale.
I have watched other Oliver Stone movies before and liked them.  I don't know what he or anyone else was thinking when they made this movie.  It was a mess.  Maybe I need to be drunk or stoned to appreciate it.<br /><br />This movie was very poorly written.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that it makes Jim Morrison look like a drunken jerk.  It was either way too long or way too slow.  Either way, it did not hold my interest.  Meg Ryan was a doll in other movies of hers.  But in here?  She just could not live up to the material.  She was definitely a poor casting choice in this movie.<br /><br />If you like The Doors, I am sure that there are better choices out there than this garbage.
If you just want to have a good time and not worry about details related to biography, this is the perfect The Doors movie.
this movie made a Doors fan of me &amp; the new edition has lots of extras &amp; 5.1 sound.  I think Oliver Stone did a wonderful job for the most part with this movie; looks so realistic which I think was one of the great things about this &amp; JFK.  Val Kilmer gives the performance of his career &amp; I think the whole cast was great.
This was a good show in all. Very Trippy!! Anyone notice that Billy Idol appeared in it?? heehee! Billy played &quot;Kat&quot;. He had brown long hair and was on crutches. He was briefly at the bar. Be careful... if you blink, you'll miss him!! :o)
i was very impressed by this film upon my first viewing it lead to a spree of doors memorabillia crowding my home and the neighbours complaining about jims wailing on the cd player, for atleast two months this movie really affected me and turned me to music that i considered flea market hippie garbage reminiscent of an era of ridiculous hygiene and recreational excess. this film has a lot of quality out bursts and is definately one of oliver stones better films but i preferred this vision as a more desirable role only in fiction, olivers jim would be right up there with travis bickle, colonel kurtz and mickey mouse but the reality would have been hideous. the book by densmore tells a more humane tale of a man who got caught up in something only he could have laughed and smiled. stones dramatisation plays like king of kings on acid with an electric guitar.
This review refers to the Artisan Special Edition(2disc)DVD of "The Doors".....<br /><br />Become immersed in the wild ride that Oliver Stone takes you on in this legendary film of a legendary rocker.The extrordinary  life story of Jim Morrison, played eeriley by Val Kilmer, will keep you mesmerized and stay with you long after the movie has ended.<br /><br />The film explores "The Doors", from their beginnings in Venice Beach, California, where they exploded onto the rock scene,breaking the mold of music in the 60's, to their rise as superstars. Morrison's life is the main focus as a senstive poet type dropping out of film school, to becoming the Peyote addicted,culture shocking, philosphical rock idol.The LSD trips, the visions of this genius, his personal life and of course the famous controversial concerts are all told through Stone's unique cinematic magic.<br /><br />You'll get lost not only in the time setting of the story but of course in the music as well. "The Doors" electrifying music is heard throughout the film and follows them chronologically on their journey. It's a film for fans of the cinema and music alike.<br /><br />As mentioned above Val Kilmer is uncanny in not only his performance as Morrison, but seems to take on the physical appearance as well. The band members played by Kevin Dillon, Kyle Maclachlan and Frank Whaley are extraordinary in their portrayals. Meg Ryan, in a very dramatic roll as Jim's girl Pam is brilliant.<br />This "Special Edition" DVD is the one to have(and it's not as expensive as the other) It's a 2 disc set, with a fabulous widescreen picture, and a 5.1 Dolby Dig(get to this through the special feature selections) audio track that will blow you away. Lots and lots of special features. On the disc with the movie you can listen to Stone's commentary where he fills you in on how the band met, the genesis of the songs, and where he has taken license with the story. The second disc is filled with featurettes and production notes. Looking at the Technical info for the other edition ("The Collectors") it seems to be longer by 30 minutes and may have some extras not included with this one, but it is not in the 5.1 which for me was the deciding factor in this film featuring this exciting soundtrack.<br /><br />So get out those mood rings and leather fringe vests and get ready to rock with "The Doors".....<br />"This Is The End"...........Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NTQC">The Very Best of the Doors</a>
"Pam joined him three years later . . ." is on my copy of the 15 Year Anniversary Edition; the movie is the same as the Special Edition.<br /><br />The packaging and menus are updated and look great. Substantially better than the special edition.<br /><br />On to the 2 new features.<br /><br />The Doors in L.A. - 20 minute feature; Robbie Krieger, John Densmore, (yaaay!), Jimmy Greenspoon, and Pamela Des Barres are the prominent interviews on camera here. Nothing earth shattering, but it's nice to see/hear John Densmore's abridged opinions.<br /><br />The Jim Morrison Phenomena in Paris - it's interesting. You've got a handful of people who met JDM in Paris and hung out; they describe his mood and what he was (arguably) saying at the time. There's a French librarian who breaks down a lot of the parallels in the subtleties of the lyrics w/Greek literature. There's a somewhat annoying 20 something saying Jim was done with music and The Doors and blah, blah, blah that isn't substantiated w/anything. There is an interview w/Michelle Rudler, who is listed as "Coroner" who says lots of things were done wrong in the documentation of Morrison's death. It's about 50 minutes.<br /><br />All of the extras on the Special Edition are here as well.<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you are looking to purchase The Doors movie on DVD, by Oliver Stone, this is the one to get. The movie is entertaining enough but, you know, it's fictional and not historically accurate enough to garner more than 3 stars from this reviewer.
(Blu-ray version)<br />For only those, who just like me, when look for a review, they only hope to find technicals opinions, nothing about the movie, history, critical or something like that, so...<br />The picture is great and the sound is great too. Buy it!
'The Doors' were one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the sixties and the quintessential California group of the decade. They so embodied the West Coast counterculture experience that viewing this biographical film about Jim Morrison and The Doors also provides a fascinating view of the cultural and spiritual forces that drove Jim and that entire generation to challenge the status quo of the American mainstream.<br /><br />What exactly is the true story of the life and death of Jim Morrison? Is it the story of one of the many rebellious young adults of the time who in looking for an alternative way of living got lost along the way in the drugs, alcohol and sexual freedom that so dominated that culture? Or is Jims' story a deeply mystical tale announcing the rebirth of ancient shamanism into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century? The story of someone chosen by the spirits to bring the 'old ways' to a new generation looking for something to fill the spiritual void brought about by the loss of belief in the Christian God?<br /><br />Director Oliver Stone has played the mythmaker to perfection in this amazing film providing us with the unique experience of entering into the American Dreamtime. Layering mundane worldly events intermitently with glimpses of the psychic, shamanic forces motivating those events we are given the opportunity to chose for ourselves what level of reality we are willing, or ready to accept. A truly remarkable accomplishment.<br /><br />As for the performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, it couldn't have been better. His ability to capture both the physcial appearance and dark persona of the legendary rock star so completely is beyond extraordinary. Without question Val was born to play this role.<br /><br />Did Jim really believe he was the "Electric Shaman" called by the spirits to open the "Doors of Perception" to a sleeping world? Was he Dionysus reborn, here to use his suggestive music and lyrics to arouse his followers and bring to fruition his new 'Rites of Spring' with "Golden copulations in the streets of L.A." More likely he was playing the part of the mischevious Indian 'Trickster' leading us once again in the wrong direction. Maybe it's just like his Mother said long ago while the old Indian lay dying along the roadside in the California desert. "It's just a dream Jimmy, that's all it is."<br /><br />So relax, show no fear, "Kiss the Snake" and enjoy the ride!
The Doors suffers the same problems that Stone's other films about real people and events (JFK and Nixon) do; Stone uses the docu-drama format as a license to condense times and events, while simultaneously inventing composite characters and situations that never existed. All too often, these films, while containing exciting filmic and visual elements, ring a bit hollow.<br /><br />The upside of The Doors is the performance of Val Kilmer, who threw himself into the role with ferocity and conviction; that he comes up short in the end isn't due to his acting abilities as much as the choice of episodes and Morrison's characteristics (both real and invented) that Stone chose to film. Simply put, Stone's Morrison comes across as little more than a sporatically gifted poet who sublimates his poetic callings to all the cliched rock star trappings. Perhaps this does describe some of Morrison's personality to a degree, but after seeing Morrison get stoned, drunk and act like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum for 2 hours plus, one wonders if Oliver thought of Morrison as basically an obnoxious drunk (possessed by the soul of a bald, silly-looking, half-naked dead indian that continually wanders around the movie) and, if so, what it was that turned Stone onto making the film in the first place...<br /><br />The downside, in addition to the lack of scope regarding Morrison, comes in the numerous episodes that never happened (The Doors tripping on acid in the desert, Patricia Kennealy being present at the New Haven show Morrison got arrested at, Particia Kennealy and Pam Courson having a catfight, Buick actually making a commercial using the song Light My Fire and Jim finding out about it by watching tv, Jim setting fire to his and Pam's house while Pam was smacked up in the closet...and on and on). Also, the years of 1967 to early 1969 take up about an hour and a half of the movie, while the remainder of 1969 through to mid 1971 take about twenty minutes.<br /><br />It's a shame that Stone went to such trouble to set up and film some great concert sequences, and Kilmer really made a terrific attempt at playing Morrison, but in the end both were content to rest the character on both the various myths about the singer and the confirmed instances of Morrison at his drunken worst. A well-shot film that, in the end, has little to do with reality.
The Southern California band The Doors were a big hit around 1966-1971. The band ended when singer Jim Morrison flew to France to pursue a different career and shortly later died due to his ongoing drug abuse.<br /><br />I'm not old enough to remember The Doors. I hail from the later era of Judas Priest and Metallica. The first time I ever heard of The Doors was when my much-older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, "The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills." Yeah, I thought the name was pretty ridiculous until I discovered Jim Morrison's reasoning behind it:<br /><br />There is what is known<br />And there is what is unknown<br />Inbetween are the doors<br /><br />Needless to say, I stopped laughing. Another thing that won my respect for The Doors was their song that was used in the opening of APOCALYPSE NOW, which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, that is, not that Frankenstein "Redux"). I didn't know the name of the song so I bought their "Best Of" album hoping to find it but unfortunately discovered that it wasn't on there. Anyway, this "Best Of" album was my first exposure to their music other than APOCALYPSE NOW and their hits that were regularly played on the radio. My first impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone but themselves. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits.' And over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting voice. Anyway, I'm more of a fan of their more artistic songs like "Riders on the Storm" and "The End" as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of "Light My Fire" or the goofy charm of "People are Strange"?<br /><br />I've only seen Oliver Stone's THE DOORS (1991) twice, including a recent viewing. The film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal pain through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted all the surrounding monuments with graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.<br /><br />So THE DOORS is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final five years of existence, an image of wild excess and abuse. Because of this, I was left with a pretty bad impression. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents at the altar of drug & alcohol idolatry.<br /><br />This is only part of the truth, I discovered. Thankfully I watched the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disk "The Road to Excess" wherein one of Morrison's sweethearts, Patricia Kenealy, the guitarist Robby and another guy give the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while generally true, aren't "all that happened." They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, sweet, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was "the most influential person I've ever met."<br /><br />In addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man and is itself worth the price of admission.<br /><br />By 1971 Jim realized that an inaccurate image was created around him, the natural byproduct of his fame. He sought to destroy this image by fleeing to France and starting a new life as a writer and filmmaker. Unfortunately Paris was decadent and he wasn't allowed to come clean. He was too famous. He couldn't escape the shackles of excess and consequently died because of it. Both Jim Morrison's life and the film are a pitiable portrait of self-destruction. What a waste of incredible talent.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: The picture is very good in a groovy kind of way. Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and very important to the success of the picture in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award, to say the least. In any event, if you're in the mood for something that will capture that late-60s counter-culture vibe THE DOORS is the film to see (next to the documentary WOODSTOCK, that is). It's mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and naturally features The Doors' music throughout. Unfortunately it offers a very limited and unflattering impression of Jim Morrison. That's why it's essential that the viewer also watch "The Road to Excess" on the second disk.<br /><br />In this documentary, by the way, Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: "To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison." Huh? Another one is: "The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom." Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess lead straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.<br /><br />CONTENT WARNING: Unless you're a total doofus, anyone choosing to view a film like THE DOORS knows that it's probably going to try to capture the 'free-love' drug culture of the late-60s. Hence, there's a lot of female nudity and overt sex & drug scenes. If you can't stomach this for whatever reason, stay away.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: The film itself: B+ The "Road to Excess" documentary: A
The people endlessly trashing this film are obviously biased against Mr. Stone, or the idea of their guru Jim Morrison being portrayed by someone else on celluloid.  I haven't read an objective review yet, which is pretty  sad, considering that this is a brilliant movie made by an extraordinary  filmmaker.  To quote James Woods reffering to Stone:  &quot;Oliver Stone is  now making films that show a subjective experience, that have no omniscient  point of view.  This guy is doing work that if it were by Orson Welles  would be hailed as genius.&quot;  I totally agree.  Stone angers a lot of  people with his risky style, and that's why his films take more heat than  most others.<p>The endless quivelling over this movie's accuracy is  downright insane!  First of all, why say &quot;If you want a true account  of the Doors, read Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek&quot;?  How can you trust  Mr. Manzarek as the definitive source for a Doors biography?  I'm sure  drugs have poisoned the memories of the entire group, and Manzarek is no  exception.  Do you people realize how involved the real-life individuals  were in the making of this biopic?  It's practically based on John  Densmore's book!  If they thought some major travesties were being  committed against the band, they wouldn't have let Stone go through with  them.  Pam Courson's family didn't let Stone portray their daughter as the  junkie she truly was.  Think about it.<p>If Morrison has no poetic side in  this film, I'd like to know why everything he said was an epiphany.  Face  it, this is a great film, and, although inaccurate, it's just a MOVIE, not  a documentary, and artistic liberties are taken with all biopics, no matter  who is at the helm.  You must admit that there are some truly brilliant  moments in this movie.  I didn't hate Morrison.  Kilmer did great, and  there should've been Oscar nods for him, as well as the *genius*  cinematography, etc.  To trash this film because it's  &quot;inaccurate&quot; is mere card stacking.
The thing about most rock movies like this one is that in reviewing them, people are often caught up in the accuracy of the presentation. Is this EXACTLY how Jim was? Is that REALLY what Patricia and Jim did together? And what about that Ed Sullivan thing, did that really happen?<br /><br />Please, people. If that's what you're looking for, watch an actual Doors concert. Watch Jim Morrison interviews. Read a decent biography. This is a MOVIE, coming straight out of Hollywood. As Oliver Stone says in the bonus features, it's his interpretation of a figure that has fascinated generations for decades, even after his untimely death in the early 1970s.<br /><br />Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. It's certainly legitimate to be annoyed at minor factual inconsistencies, and the like. Also, this movie was bound to make at least SOME of Jim's closest relations angry. Patricia Kennealy hates poor Mr. Stone with a passion (but then she hates most everyone these days, so that's probably not saying much). Ray Manzerek, keyboardist for the Doors, called the movie "atrocious". Perhaps this isn't what Jim was like -- in my opinion, it was slightly unfair, the way Stone handled Jim's drug and alcohol issues.<br /><br />However, despite all this, I love the movie. It wasn't supposed to answer any questions, it was supposed to represent one man's image of the Lizard King ("whatever that means"), and this image is surprisingly universal. He recreates the hazy world of 60s L.A. with magnificent usage of color, music, and set, so that this movie is a visual feast. The Doors songs scattered throughout are also quite accurately placed -- the misty effects of 'Riders on the Storm' are especially poignant in the beginning of the film, and a recurring theme in 'The End' is an interesting film technique. All in all, it builds a very interesting view of the late 60s, Jim Morrison, the Doors, and their world.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and the acting. The acting in this movie is tremendous. Meg Ryan does a wonderful job as Pamela Courson (Jim's common law wife, and longtime love), with a great performance in a violent Thanksgiving scene. Though I forget her name, the actress playing the witchwife Patricia Kennealy is also quite impressive, though based on the real-life Kennealy's recent endeavours, I'm not sure how realistic her interpretation was. And, of course, the impeccable Val Kilmer. Some may say he didn't display all the facets of Jim to the extent that he could, I say don't blame him for that, blame the script. His performances onstage conduct the same energy Morrison himself provoked in a crowd, his MysteriousDrunkenPoet interpretation was perfect for the mood Stone set, and I challenge any nonbelievers to watch Kilmer sing 'Light My Fire', and then put the actual song on. To the average listener - perhaps even the above-average listener - there is NO DIFFERENCE. The voice, the word-breaks, the tone... it's all perfectly on the mark. It's scary, actually.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I challenge any negative critics of Stone's movie to include all of its features in their consideration. Oliver Stone did not catch Jim Morrison on film. He encapsulated the mystery, the enigma that was Jim Morrison. He opens more questions than answers them, and rightly so. The only person that can REALLY claim to know what Jim was like is Jim himself, and of course he's not exactly around to do so. This movie is a triumph as a film, with amazing visuals, brilliant acting, and a true passion for the subject. It's extremely enjoyable, and comes highly recommended.
Hey, I know I'm in the minority in my opinion here on Amazon, yet I will state unequivocally my view that the portrayal of Jim Morrison, his common-law wife Pamela Courson, the group, and even the supporting cast of regulars in The Doors Universe come off like characters in search of a serious screenwriter.<br /><br />Come on already, Oliver.  Who could sympathize with Jim and Company when they spew out lines of dialogue clipped, of all places, from Morrison's song lyrics?  Did you actually think an audience would accept Jim uttering such discordant lines in an everyday conversation?  Could you not separate the man from the performer?  Because of that awful bit of writing, Jim comes off like a buffoon, not an erudite talent who, despite a lifetime of loneliness, alienation, and addictive tendencies (which would ultimately snuff out his life), still managed to push aside material comfort for a pursuit of the truth as he saw it.<br /><br />Also, how come Jim revels in such horrible psychobabble?  Had you not gleamed the interviews (available through Bright Midnight and other retailers) you'd hear an incredibly bright, articulate young man who lamented the day he elected to be part of a rock and roll band.  You'd also have the makings of excellent drama, as a man who cannot escape his fame and a man who longed to create films and poetry in his own right.<br /><br />How could one ever sympathize with a drunken lout (YOUR Jim) who acts like an ass (seems more like Val Kilmer playing himself rather than Jim), shows no compassion whatsoever, and just appears to become famous in one quick turn of events.  The only clue we have to the success stems from the Sullivan show, the airport raid, and assorted concerts, but we never get a sense of Jim being nationally lambasted.  Some archival footage might have helped there.  But of course then the more sedate, intelligent Morrison--whom you portrayed as bumping into cops whereas Jim preferred to sway at a mike stand (see the archival footage)--doesn't figure in a Hollywood biopic.<br /><br />What a shame.  What a rotten, dirty, salacious mess.  Maybe your own demons got the better of your good sense, Oliver.  God knows, if your Morrison had been the true Morrison, I'd never had been a fan of his in the first place.  Thanks for turning Jim into David Lee Roth, the members of KISS, Robert Plant, and all those other Circus Magazine posterboys for rock and roll excess.  Too bad.  An integrity, a nonmaterial nature, and a sincere attraction to make art distinguishes Jim from all those other Sex, Drug, and Rock and Roller hellions.
First, let me start off by saying that Val Kilmer's performance in this film is nothing short of genius.  He literally became Jim Morrison, almost to the point that I thought that Val was actually a mental patient who thought he WAS Jim Morrison.  There are many times during the film that I had to tell myself that it wasn't Jim that had come back from the dead.  Second, Oliver Stone is a brilliant director and he can make the viewer feel as if he has just stepped into a time machine and gone back to visit the 60's--that's how authentic the setting is in this movie.<br />However, the problem that I sometimes have with Oliver Stone is that he has a tendancy to go a little to overboard in his films, and "The Doors" is a perfect example of this.  We all know that Jim Morrison was a troubled soul, but, hey, let's face it--most of your artistic geniuses are, which what makes their work so incredible.  Stone, however, made Jim Morrison out to be some acid-draining Nazi that cared only about himself and had violent outbursts all the time.  In reality, though, if one does a little research, one finds out that Jim was only like that some of the time and not every second of his life.  This movie, I felt, failed to show more of the beautiful maverick poet/shaman that Jim, most of the time, really was.<br />Also, I felt that the sex angle was overplayed a bit, as well.  Obviously Jim had slept with a number of women, and the women that weren't able to, most likely fantasized about being with Jim.  However, it was if this film made Jim out to be so horny that he would actually have sex with mannequins at the local department store.<br /><br />In reality, when all is said and done, the only real saving grace of this film was Val Kilmer's outstanding performance as well as Stone's accurate re-creation of the trippin' sixties.
The rock group The Doors were perfect fodder for Oliver Stone's powerful, vivid and radical imagination...to say nothing of his talent.  If you are reading this, you probably know the rough outline of The Doors and Jim Morrison, their mercurial lead singer.<br /><br />So let's cut right to it: Val Kilmer IS Jim Morrison in this film.  It is one of the most impressive acting jobs ever put down on film and though he received critical acclaim for the performance, his performance was worth all of the Oscars (if anyone remembers any of them) handed out the year this film was released and should have been the CENTER of critical acclaim.<br /><br />In addition, there is a strong supporting cast filling in the personages of Densmore, Manzarek and Krueger, Morrison's talented, but sometimes baffled bandmates.  But the star here is Stone.<br /><br />Oliver Stone films are as close to an acid trip as you will ever get minus actually digesting the chemical.  From the opening monologue over the shadowy desert to the psychedelic highs of "Light My Fire" to the down and out, bloated and bearded Morrison of "Riders On The Storm" to the predictable outcome in Paris, Stone's amazing directorial talents shine and truly make this a film to experience, not just view.<br /><br />Stone's on-the-edge style was tailor-made for a band that challenged it's listeners to "Break On Through".  The soundtrack rules, with a plethora of The Doors' classics (the underappreciated "Roadhouse Blues" among them), a little help from The Velvet Underground, some classical thrown in for good measure and Morrison's poetry (performed by Morrison).<br /><br />There is a great cameo by Paul Rothchild, the band's producer and bit parts for Billy Idol, Bill Graham and Crispen Glover (as Andy Warhol and as creepy as ever).  The great Michael Madsen and Kathleen Quinlan (who plays a would-be witch and dances naked - worth the price of admission right there!) also shine.<br /><br />But, again, it is Stone that makes this movie roll.  Does he lean too heavily on Morrison's dark side and over emphasize the wild side of his personality (Morrison also is said to have had a sweet, low key and compassionate side)?  Probably, but factual accuracy has never been Stone's forte' (reference "JFK").  But a rock group's daily comings and goings are not the stuff that crumbles nations and Stone can be forgiven here. I suggest finding the biggest screen you can and the best surround sound.  You will be transported and, when it's all over, you'll stagger off to bed....Stoned.
If you love the real Doors, stay clear of this miasma.<br /><br />The Doors, I always thought were the greatest rock band of all time, but this vapid flick, created by a brain-dead Hollywood dodo makes the late, great Jim Morrison and the rest of The Doors look foolish, idiotic and talenless goofballs.<br /><br />This travesty of a flick basically left me fairly angry. I may just have to re-read (for the third time) No One Here Gets Out Alive, and will surely play some Doors music to get rid of the aftertaste left in this viewer's mouth by the rancid Oliver Stone attempt.
I saw this movie when it first came out (March 1, 1991).  I was 21 years old, and a huge DOORS fan.  I liked it okay back then, but upon seeing it now, it's boring, and makes it appear that the other members did little or nothing to contribute to the band and its success (Robby Krieger, the guitar player, WROTE 'LIGHT MY FIRE').  I think Val Kilmer does an Oscar-caliber job as Jim, but the others are only there to react to things Jim says and does.  They have no other purpose except to fill in those roles-most anyone could have done that.  I don't think a lot of people realize that Jim Morrison was many things, BUT HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN.  HE DIDN'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT, and he wasn't THAT great a singer (though I will say that he was damn good when he was good).  THE DOORS were a great band, but that was a long time ago.  As far as the studio albums go, the first two were great, the second two were mediocre (though 'STRANGE DAYS' has a couple of decent tracks), and the last two were hit and miss.  I wasn't there, so I don't know about how they were live (videos and live CDs are NOT THE SAME as being there).  Another reviewer said that Meg Ryan was a poor choice to play Pam.  I agree.  Listening to Stone talk about it on disc 2 tells us why.  Ryan sounds like she was/is unable to comprehend the type of behavior that Pam/Jim engaged in, i.e. drugs, rebellion, etc.  Stone said the same thing about Darryl Hannah regarding her failed attempt to play Darian in WALL STREET (a far superior movie to this one by the way).  I don't understand why Stone would choose to have someone play a role like this when they obviously were unable to 'find and be' the character they were supposed to be portraying.  Stone should have chosen more wisely.  I think Stone's obsession with Jim is the reason this movie is really all about Jim.  Of the many problems in it, the one that probably bothers me the most is that the movie acts like Jim is the center of the universe, as the camera is almost always on him.  But Oliver Stone's Jim Morrison is juvenile, destructive, obnoxious, and often, pointless.  He hardly comes off as a genius, poetic or otherwise.  He suddenly has star status, but the movie doesn't show why-we're supposed to know why.  Yet, why should we care??? The character is despicable, at least that's the way he's written here.  I couldn't even finish the film-I simply didn't care that he was headed for a youthful demise.  When I read 'Riders on the Storm' and 'No One Here Gets Out Alive', I found myself caring about the people involved-not here though.  Moreover, the photography was irritating, to say the least.  I wanted to know about THE DOORS, instead, I got an MTV-type drug trip with DOORS music behind it.  As a big studio movie, I think this fails on all levels except one-Val Kilmer's performance.  As another reviewer noted, this is the best acting he's ever done.  It's too bad that the movie/script he had to work with was/is over-hyped junk.
I like the Doors music, and Morrison was a very charasmatic figure who wrote some bizzare but interesting lyrics. However, this film(unlike the comments made by most)is not a strict biography. What was covered semi-accurately in the movie was the atmosphere of the sixties and the bands beginnings. Okay, they showed the crazy drunk Morrison that perpetuates the myth, but this guy was more interesting. There are also many stupid inaccuracies. One big one that can easily be proven is the live Ed Sullivan TV appearence. Morrison did not look close into the camera and emphasize the words "much higher". I think the guy was on the wrong track big time, but that doesn't take away from his intelligence. He was very smart. The idea of this film was to show all of Morrisons wild antics. It was a big mistake to have Val Kilmer sing some Doors songs, but he did do a very good job of capturing Morrisons personality. There were definetely some good scenes that showed the bands tension and the tumultuous relationship he had with Pamela(Meg Ryan). The natural likeability side of Morrison was missing from the film. Oliver Stone(director)should have delved deeply into the fallen rock stars last days in Paris(alot of material there)which would have been a more facinating watch. Morrisons real death story, the attempted cover up, paranoia by Pam and rushed burial were also missing. Instead we got the glorified figure in the bath tub with slightly religious imagery. That is very movie phony. This guy would have looked a mess. All said and done, the film reached, grabbed on at times and let go; Hey just like Morrison.
The Doors, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison is an epic and visually stunning film that attempts to tell not only about the rise and fall of a band, and in particular its singer, a complex and enigmatic figure, but also about the "Strange Days" of a unique period in history known as The 60's. People who complain about the facts being distorted are missing the point. Due to the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, this film isn't aiming for objective truth. It is Stone's vision, and besides, a lot of the events didn't occur in the physical realm at all:<br /><br />------<br />Jim Morrison: I believe in a long prolonged derangement of the senses to attain the unknown... Although I live in the subconscious, our pale reason hides the infinite from us.<br />=================<br /><br />What we have with Morrison is a rock star who wanted to be a poet--who was a poet. He wanted to be Dionysus, the god of wine, the inspirer of ritual madness and ecstasy, and he became Dionysus. In becoming the physical embodiment of Dionysus on Earth he may have fudged his facts. He may have neglected to mention that his father was an Admiral, rather than deceased as he claimed. In creating his own myth, he may have played fast and loose with the truth, but once again, you are missing the point.<br /><br />"Mr Mojo Risin" is an anagram for "Jim Morrison"<br /><br />Val Kilmer really wanted to play this role, and he tried very hard to be cast, even going as far as recording a demo of himself singing Doors songs. According to Stone and some band members, when given the blindfold test with Kilmer's tape, they couldn't tell the difference. From the first frame of The Doors he IS Jim Morrison. He starts out as a young and relatively innocent Jim Morrison and carries the character through to his final days as a bloated and bearded beast. Jim Morrison was the self proclaimed Lizard King. Morrison WAS the Lizard King, but he could also be an obnoxious drunk, and both things are true. Val Kilmer gave an awesome performance as Jim Morrison, both the poet and the obnoxious drunk, both the man and the myth.<br /><br />Aiding and abetting Val Kilmer's performance, just as The Doors ably supported Morrison, was an excellent cast with a few standouts that I would like to mention:<br /><br />Kyle MacLachlan as Doors Keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Kevin Dillon as drummer John Densmore, and Frank Whaley as guitarist Robby Krieger were very supportive. They kind of stayed in the background, but as sidemen that is their gig. When you have a charismatic actor like Val Kilmer playing an even more charismatic singer like Jim Morrison, you know you're not going to steal the show. They all learned how to play their instruments, which took a lot of time and practice, though MacLachlan may have had it in his blood already, as he claims he's a descendent of Johan Sebastion Bach.<br /><br />Michael Madsen was Tom Baker, an actor best known for a Warhol film, "I, a Man" but he was friends with Morrison long before that. In the film, I got the impression that they met through Warhol, but the reverse is true. Morrison was supposed to play opposite Nico, but management talked him out of it, and he suggested his drinkin' buddy Tom Baker for the role. Anyway, Madsen is menacing as Baker, even though Morrison has already descended to a pretty depraved level, you are concerned when Madsen shows up. Uh oh, this guy is a really bad influence! Actually, Madsen provides one of the best scenes, when Baker berates Morrison for becoming a bloated beast and belittles his accomplishments:<br /><br />-----------<br />Tom Baker: [to Jim] Whatcha gonna do for act three, man? Puke on Heaven's door?<br />=================<br /><br />Billy Idol as Cat has a good comeback, though. He tells Baker that IF he ever does anything, please tell him so he can whiz on it. Billy Idol was supposed to have a much bigger role but due to a motorcycle accident, it was severely curtailed. A pity.<br /><br />Meg Ryan gave a great performance as Pamela Courson, Jim's girlfriend. She was somewhere between Sally Albright in "When Harry Met Sally" and Bonnie in "Hurlyburly." Kind of a girl-next-door, all bright and bubbly, who with prolonged exposure to Jim's decadence becomes a bonnie bit of guttersnipe. Ryan wavered between and balanced the two extremes well.<br /><br />Kathleen Quinlan portrayed Patricia Keneally well. Patricia was a rock journalist who questions some of the facts in Morrison's self made myth, but also falls for the devil may care singer. In fact, she's a practicing Wiccan and the two are wed in a Handfast ceremony. Quinlan was also in Apollo 13, giving her a Bacon Number of 1. The real Keneally complained that she was falsely depicted, but Stone admits she was a composite character culled from perhaps 10 different women, compressed into her character in the name of dramatic economy.<br /><br />Michael Wincott also made quite an impression as record producer Paul Rothchild. Though he no doubt looked nothing like the man who had produced the first six of The Doors albums, besides lots of other credits to his name, Wincott gave another of his trade marked intense performances. Catch him in "Basquiat" if you want to see more of his work.<br /><br />Like Mr Mojo Risin', Oliver Stone is likewise in the myth creation business. He bent the facts to dramatize the story and make it more cinematic. I wasn't buying so much Oliver Stone's use of the Indian Shaman as metaphor, but I will allow him such conceits. Director Oliver Stone felt a deep connection to the singer that began when Stone was a soldier in Viet Nam. He wasn't a popular music person before that, but hearing The Doors music really struck a chord. His first screenplay, which formed the basis for his film "Platoon" was originally envisioned with the main character played by Jim Morrison, and Stone actually contacted Morrison about playing the role. Stone sees The Doors as filling the void in all that Flower Power during the 60's. They were the darkness amidst all that sunshine. He sees a parallel with himself in that he's an artist who goes to that dark place, who pushes into that deep, dark abyss.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who didn't like his depiction of Jim Morrison and The Doors, but I take a different view. Ray Manzarek has since said that the movie is a horrible account of the history of the band. Ray did not participate or contribute in the making of the film, though he was asked. Maybe his dissatisfaction prompted him to write his own book in 1998: *Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors*. The other two band members, Krieger and Densmore, participated in the film. In fact, Krieger wanted Stone to do the project because he was a fan of the film "Salvador" and he convinced the other Doors to sign on. Densmore's book, *Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and the Doors*, an account of the band's rise and fall from his own perspective, was a primary source of material for the film. It took 20 years for the film to be made, mostly due to getting permission from the band and family members.<br /><br />So, bottom line: It was Oliver Stone's tribute to Jim Morrison, and if other people saw him differently, they should write their own book or make their own movie. If you want to learn more about Jim, read those other books, or better yet read his poetry and listen to his music.<br /><br />It's fitting that Jim Morrison is buried in Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re Lachaise, alongside such poets and artists as Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Guillaume Apollinaire, Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Bizet, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, Isadora Duncan, St&eacute;phane Grappelli, Amedeo Modigliani, Moliere, Yves Montand, &Eacute;dith Piaf, Marcel Proust, Gioacchino Rossini, Georges-Pierre Seurat, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />THE TOP TEN MOST PERTAINENT FILM ROLES BY THE CAST OF THE DOORS<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F2L9">Masked and Anonymous</a> (2003) ....

The best performance in the film was Kyle McLachlan's Ray Manzarek, even though his part was small. Val Kilmer lacks charisma in his portrayal of the late charismatic singer Jim Morrison. How can a man who is perpetually stoned and wrapped up in his own little world be interesting or charismatic? I found Kilmer's Morrison unlikeable and unwatchable. The Stone/Kilmer Morrison has no redeeming qualities - casually and carelessly hurting everyone in his path with his selfish, hedonistic lifestyle. I actually fast-forwarded through quite a bit of this film because every scene was just "more of the same".
If there is any thing bad about this movie is that it does not go on forever and ever.The life of Jim Morrison is one story that can never be portrayed in words or pictures but this effort is worth a praise.Though it does not really shows what a good company Jim was but it do keeps you goin through the worst parts of life.If you really wanna see why this man was and still is a mystery,You must watch this movie.
The film is terrible and incorrect from the opening credits to the end or when you press the stop button, which ever comes soonest. There is error after error after error on this film. Oilver Stone ammitted to telling some small lies to expand on bigger truths however he never even started telling the truths. Whatever a director could get wrong he got wrong,Morrison's character, names, dates, events and sequencing. Many so called events never even took place, the burning wardrobe and the turkey dinner for example - pure fiction. You like The Doors or Jim Morrison or you want to learn more about them stay away from this product and look for something else. This product is nothing more than insulting to The Doors and Jim Morrison and the one star option was the lowest rating I could give, personally the one star is being generous.
The best die young.  That is a cliche', but when you think of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Mama "Cass" Elliot and Jim Morrison, there is truth in that wisdom as you look back upon the late 60's and 70's music genre.  This film, a classic by Oliver Stone and what should have been an Academy Award winning performance for Val Kilmer, is a revival of one of the most remarkable rock musicians of all time - Jim Morrison... Morrision was a charismatic wizard of rock...and mesmerized his audiences not only with music...but with his poetic talents and mastery of the English language.  Yes...Morrison defined his life with the statement - "I am the Lizard King...I can do anything" - and this film captures the essence of that statement.  Val Kilmer was perfectly cast in this film.  He was either kin to Morrison or found a piece of his soul when trying to emulate the influence JM had on the youth of the Sixties.  I'd give this film a rating of "6" if it were within the rating scale.  Meg Ryan is so convincing, I asked my friends if she ever had a romantic relationship with Val Kilmer outside of this film.  No one knew.  And the soundtrack (of course) is awesome.  If I had led such a tragic life as JM...and had wallowed in the mire (no pun intended) with alcohol and drugs like he...I would have been honored to have such a film pay a tribute to my life.  This is, by far, the best film ever produced on the life and times of the Sixties.
must see for any music fan.  val kilmer is a near look-a-like and has his mannerisms down well.  but you can't help wishing that jim had portrayed himself.  his childlike sweetness, expression, looks, pure sex appeal, his tortured psyche.  as good as kilmer is in this movie, see dick wolf's documentary "when you're strange".  jim morrison was greater and bigger than anything an actor could ever  hope to capture.  his voice was pure sex and made his words penetrate your depths.  his words were everything to him.  he was a poet.  he was a genius.  he was tortured.  must that always lead to self destruction?  why?  as johnny depp says at the end of the film,  "some say he was just another rock star who crashed and  burned."  "but this much is true,  you can't burn out if you're not on fire".  what we take from this what a holocaust jim morrison truly was.  wish he were still here to tell us how he survived his demons.....he's not.  but we have his music.  it will last long after we who survived him are all gone.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H5WF3U">When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors</a>
The Doors is not the best movie. While the begining of the movie seems to promise something good, and the end of the movie has you walk away with some emotions. After this first hour of this nearly two and half hour movie, it becomes boring.<br /><br />There is hardly any focus on the music. Besides the concerts, events of the movie seem pointless. Their only point seems to show how crazy the singer was. Jim Morrison, the singer and main charater, was just a crazy idiot, and thats not what he was in real life. The last thirty minutes will respark interest, but does not save the movie at all.<br /><br />I would recommend someone to rent this movie, not buy it.
The video resolution is very poor, I in fact have to watch the DVD in "zoomed" mode in order for it to make it fit the screen.
This movie transported me back to the 60's. It brought back some great memories. The sound track is excellent!!!!!
The particular filmography of Oliver Stone has had peak and lows. He is - before any other circumstance - a CSI filmmaker. His camera is an untiring explorer of facts, livings and memories. That is why my personal list of his treasures films possibly do not include his most succesful works.<br /><br />This is one of my three favorite Opus of Stone; (my other tweo choice are JFK and Wall Street). This movie works out as historical document, due its shocking realism but the the loyal refelect of USA in those ages. Being an exception figure O.S. innquires and carves in releief the expectations, defeats and livings of whole generation, tired of waiting who felt Jim Morrison was the icon of his generation, the direct descendent of the beatnik ages headed by Alan Gingsberg and Andy Warhol. The script is so well built and the performances are so natural and spontaneous; the towering acting of Kilmer and the fabulous scenaries conform a majuscule and interweaved puzzle of multidimensional resonance.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.
I'll keep my review short and simple.  This is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies.  Val Kilmer should have won an Oscar for his performance, or at least received more praise.  Oliver Stone knows that his story isn't 100% true and he never claimed it to be.  This was his vision of The Doors, and with the help of Robbie Kreiger, Patricia Kennealy, Pamela Courson-Morrison's parents and John Densmore, he did an incredible job.  However, Meg Ryan wasn't all that.  She's a decent actress, but not worthy/cool enough to play Pamela Morrison.  When the movie came out, Meg talked about how over-rated she thinks The Doors(the band) are and that Jim Mrrison was just a drunk.  Well, Meg, why associate yourself with the movie then?  Anyway, the movie is an amazing experience.
This is an excellent film about Jim Morrison and the Doors. While it is true that it is not completely accurate(Oliver Stone directed it so how would it be)and is sometimes way over the top it is still an entertaining and intresting movie. I've watched it several times(I love the Doors and Jim)and it holds up to the repeated views. If you like classic rock or the Doors then I would encourage this because it is a great picture of the 60's and of Jim. Val Kilmer does a superb job as Jim. He looks, speaks and even sings like Jim. Meg Ryan is good as his wife. Anyways I highly reccomend this!
Amazing movie... fun to watch and a total trip. (Seriously, this movie gives me a contact-high every time I watch it!)  Val Kilmer is really great and of course the music is awesome.  Oliver Stone is quite the visual weaver.  This is a great film for anyone interested in the Doors - and if you're not?  This film will GET you into them.
The first time I watched this movie was at a party.  I had no clue who The Doors were, wasn't really paying attention, and never really saw the ending, however something clicked.  The next day I went to rent the movie  and really sit down and watch it.  I never had a thing for Val Kilmer as an  actor or really cared about Oliver Stone movies either.  But after watching  this movie made me fall in love with the Door's music.  After buying all  their albums and books and reading into the band I found that the movie was  not really exact in the band and the life of Jim.  And the band members  today say they were upset with the movie.  However, die hard fan or someone  that wants to visit the era in a movie, will enjoy this flick.  Watch this  movie as entertainment the way Oliver Stone wanted you to see it and not  necessarily to get their life story.  The movie is filled with some of the  best Doors songs there are and can take you back to the era that many  people wish never ended.  Val Kilmer played an excellent role looking and  even voicing Jim.  If you are somewhat interested in the band, the era, or  slipping away from reality for a couple hours, I highly recommend this  movie!
I have read about a dozen books on The Doors. Needless to say they are one of the GREATEST bands ever to enter the human ear. In fact, I personally, believe they are the GREATEST band ever (Yes, even better than the  Beatles), so I'd have to say the movie was not what it should have been.  The Doors were art. The movie was not. The movie prefered to concentrate on  the (semi-fiction) &quot;antics&quot; of a mentally unbalanced Jim  Morrison, instead of the poetic side. Also the movie did not live up to  it's own title! It's called &quot;The Doors,&quot; not &quot;The life and  times of Jim Morrison!&quot; It should have concentrated on the band more  (not to say Jim was not a very interesting person...HE WAS!!!) Anyhow,  other than a few lies (ok, more than a few) it's overall an entertaining  movie. Watch it for Val Kilmer as Jim (EXCELLENT performance!!), watch it  for the WONDERFUL concert scenes, and watch it for the great soundtrack,  but don't count on a truthful account of the greatest band EVER!
I just watched this movie again a few days ago, and the photography sticks in my mind.  There are more special effects in The Doors than in Star Wars.  I think this movie represents a change in Oliver Stone's career.  I didn't like some of his earlier films as much as other people.  The most interesting films to me were the ones where he used a lot of special photography to convey the message like JFK, Nixon, Any Given Sunday, even Natural Born Killers (although I think Killers hits a doorstop in the prison scenes).  There are scenes in Killers that have the kind of visual exuberance and improvisations inherent in the message, almost like a fairy tale.<br /><br />The Doors uses cinema the way Apocalypse Now uses cinema.  What I mean by that is the montages, the feeling of immersion, the adult manner in which the cinema handles the plot.  It pulls out the stops and goes as deep as the mental state it portrays without being too "preachy".  Those are Stone's preferable qualities to me.  The Oliver Stone films lacking those presentation techniques I speak of were shot so gritty to the extent of degrading the moral, and they had little beauty or gloss in them, which are the things that were put into The Doors and the above few I mentioned.<br /><br />Stone's better films are the ones like this one that treats his subjects as fairy tales for adults.  They are the ones that take me on a colorful ride and display what those things look like in one's imagination, and then plays with them like fairy tales.  They should be vivid and colorful.  They should not make me hate the world, but have me make better choices in the world.<br /><br />If you are interested in Oliver Stone in the same manner, you may also want to read his book, A Child's Night Dream.
This is one of Val Kilmer's best movies.  If you didn't know you would actually believe he was Morrison. If you haven't seen it you need to and if you dont' own it you should especially if you are a Doors or a Kilmer fan. I give this movie two thumbs up.
Actually, the Doors was Jim Morrison and some other guys.  Oh sure, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore contributed to the music and the sound, no doubt, but without Morrison the Doors would have been a long forgotten L.A. band.  Or do you rate "Other Voices" and "Full Circle" as classics?  Yeah, I didn't think so.<br /><br />Now that we have that settled, this imperfect movie rates the 5 on the relatively soft Amazon scale for one huge reason, the spot-on near clone performance of Val Kilmer, surely the role of his life so far.  I can recall few, if any, portrayals that are a closer match to the real person.  The face, the expressions, the movements and that voice . . . wow.  The scene in the Whiskey, fading in through the indian's eye, it's one of the best things put on film, ever.  The movie isn't great, it moves too fast and leaves a lot out, but there are great things in it.<br /><br />I also liked the way the movie paid homage to the Morrison mythos too; was he really possessed?  Did they raise Dionysus in concert?  Could he really recite from memory obscure books found only in the library of Congress?  Well, maybe not, but there was something spiritual about Morrison, the man was one of those "great souls" whose personality dominated all around him.  He had a certain amount of art in him, all written in his poetry book before they even started, and when it was done, he was done, and he was gone, probably still wearing the same shoes and pants.  His life, though tragic, was pure rock and roll.  Everyone dies.  Morrison lived like a skyrocket.  The movie is a fitting tribute, with no holds barred.<br /><br />By the way, the original version of this movie carried one last line of print before the credits, in case you're curious.  Her family managed to get it removed, but it said "Pam joined him three years later . . .".<br /><br />PS:  What's the "Soldier Blue" DVD picture doing here?  (a/o 12-06-06).
Val Kilmer might as well be Jim Morrison reincarnate.  He was too good for the part.  It was beyond amazing... it was downright eerie.  From Jim's singing/talking voice, all the way to his maneurisms and his drug-addiction and his beliefs, and what he looked like... Val Kilmer got it all.  All I can say is, somehow,  JIM MORRISON WAS HAUNTING THIS FILM.<br /><br />Because of that, and because of the incredible supporting cast, really hot women, and the splended choice of songs used for the movie, The Doors is an amazing masterpiece about an incredible rock group.  I wish I had been alive in that time to truly see the Doors live instead of being forced to see their concerts on TV and on DVD.<br /><br />This DVD is an awesome bio-movie about the band, and about Jim Morrison.<br /><br />And about Val Kilmer... I had first seen Val Kilmer act as Batman in Batman Forever, and after that, I didn't think too highly of his acting skills.  It was an okay Batman, but he just didn't do that good.  But then I saw this movie, and I began looking at what else Val Kilmer has done, and I realized, it wasn't Val Kilmer who sucked in Batman Forever (It was just his bad luck that he had to read that particular script)... it was Robin and the mediocrity of the movie itself.  As I said above, it was eerie watching him play Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The DVD also has great features, a lot of Deleted Scenes that I think should be put back into the movie, and over-all is very worth-it.<br /><br />Now, an unrated one with all those Deleted Scenes put back in would be incredible.
Alot of people have said that this movie isn't completely accurate...and even though that is true...the movie was amazing! The acting was great. They could not have found anyone else to play the part of someone as amazing as Jim Morrison...Val Kilmer was fantastic! You really felt like you were seeing Jim all over again. And while it is true that this movie only shows the wild and drug-addicated side of Jim, the movie...the acting...and the direction is great! Oliver Stone did a great job of showing Jim the way that Oliver saw him...and Oliver even said that was how it was supposed to be...an opinion and a vision that he had. So with that in mind...and the fact that Val Kilmer, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, and Meg Ryan did an amazing job, this movie is one of those...turn out the lights and let your mind go...kind of movies! A MUST SEE!!!
I have been a true doors fan for some years. I am 15 years old, and I first discovered doors music when I would hear it coming from the room of my older brother when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I picked up these songs when I bought the doors first album when I was about 12 and it just clicked in and I remembered how all the songs sounded. This movie was also quite an inspiration to my devotion as a doors fan. Val Kilmer is excellent as Jim Morrison. Many negative reviews are written about how Oliver Stone didn't &quot;accurately&quot; portray the doors. The fact is that everyone has there own opinion about how Jim Morrison was and how he acted and that is was Oliver Stone did when he made the film. It was based on what he felt the doors and Jim Morrison were like. Jim had many many sides to him, crazy, funny, caring, kind, happy, dark, etc. I believe that the doors will always be my absolute most favorite band because of there unique sound, exceptional lyrics, and incredible singer/poet.
...Mr. Kilmer is dead-on as the Lizard King, the &quot;band&quot; nails the look of a band really performing and the trippy visuals are all in the spirit of the era from which the Doors sprang. Man, either rock or get the hell out of the way ...
This is one of the greatest films about the greatest band and Jim. I have read many books about the life of the doors and the movie is pretty much online with everything else. No one person can know eactly everything that  went on in the Doors life but this movie is excellent. I have listened to  there music, read books on them, visited Jim's Grave and have experiecned  some of the things Jim had done in his life. The movie was a great reality  that Val Kilmer portrayed flawlessly. I encourage every person that has an  intrest in the Doors and life back then to purchase this movie. Also I  think there is gonna be a new movie out this year from Ray, hopefully it is  as a great as this one.
Hello there,<br /><br />THE FILM THAT BLEW THE COVER OF THE LEGEND THAT IS THE DOORS<br /><br />The Doors revokes the worldwide interest of shamanism and the protection of the environment against illegal construction corporate activities and still continues to leave the lives of whoever watch it changed forever.<br />Watching the Doors is beyound reading the works of Bob Frizzel or Drunvalo Melchizedek or having a chat with Stewart Swerdlow.<br />The film touches the heart of the entire population on this planet as it continues to be watched - this time by myself , yesterday and being finished today. Jim Moors died happy - looking towards the limit of the horizon , having freed himself finally from his mortal body , in the year 1971. He was a first class self - initiated shaman who followed the Native American Tradition , according to Stone , and not Satanism , as portrayed in the rock'n roll classic documentary Hell's Bells.<br />So obsessed with freeing his soul from his mortal body did Jim Morrison become that nothing else mattered , sometimes not even 'the one'or his wife.<br />Jim Morrison taught people that in order to overcome fear you must confront it - literally. He was totally unafraid of fame and fortune and definately did not literally believe in Satan. He believed instead , according to Stone , in the Great Spirit being nature itself and loved the desert - out there , like Charles Manson , Jim Morrison felt restful and at peace and at one with his heart and the girl he loved who would grow up and become one of the most famous women of all time , who would have even silent wannabes wanting to be like her among many of America's leading politicians , such as Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton , who must have secretly desired to be wives of Jim Morrison in some of their sickest , sexcual fantasies which can only be defined as normal due to the spirit of the times.<br />And what's wrong with any woman wanting to be the wife of a famous rock star? What Jim Morrison exposed was the body of our once inner policeman , who is slowly being killed and whose body is still in the process of being processed. That is what he means when he says that most of us are in fact slaves. I do not even allow myself to speak profanely here when I state that , so I'll leave the spirit of Jim Morrison to once again remind us of the importance of NOT BEING SLAVES to anyone , even ourselves. But Jim Morrison ended up being a slave to the drugs that he was so quick to get addicted to , and freed himself from his drug slavery in the end , fearlessly , calmly , rationally , irrationally , spatially , happily , sexually , fantastically , and quite honestly brilliantly.<br />He became one of history's greatest rock stars , and as Michael Jackson died , so would his generation be resurrected. Finally Jim Morrison roams free in the spirit world - let's hope he does not end up in a place belonging to the mind of such people as Peggy Kane when it comes to talk about his hopefully happy afterlife. The film explodes the senses with it's surreal lack of special effects , and bestows upon the entire population of the people of the United States a form of nakedness and self - exposure which a worker in the black project programmes can only dream of. Jim Marrison may have been a black tulip that got eaten by drugs - but in the end he defeated his drug addiction doing it the only way he thought appropriate at that time.<br />He wanted to defy death , and sometimes wondered if he could defy his own fame. He believed in life , liberty , hope , love , hate , anything a man can believe in - and loved his wife and children more than anyone and anything. He was a man who had it all , and got it all in the end , got bored by it , and wanted to explore more. For the spirit of the personality that was Jim Morrison still lives on to this day. Therefore I say that this is without doupt , Oliver Stone's best film. Everything is changing now as our society chooses to abandon zealous materialism , and all kinds of extreme forms of variations of religions , and new and more forgiving varieties of spirituality are constructed , out of the ashes of the less forgiving cults.<br />Everything is changed in the mind of the viewer of this film - it quite literally tunes you in , then drops you out and that with more sheer quality of surreal realism than anything Videodrome by David Chronenberg had ever attempted to do , an equally fascinating and good film to watch nonetheless. This is one of a kind of a movie - and there aren't that many musical films I've seen. Way to go Oliver Stone , still receiving honest and positive criticism on this brilliant work of genius whose immortal spirit can never be defeated , and way to go for Val Kilmer.<br />This is the best EVER movie I've ever seen starring him.
This Movie is awesome it was beautifally directed by Oliver Stone and has the best cast ever! This movie Explores the dynasty of one of the greatest bands ever THE DOORS! If you are a big fan of the doors like me you will love this movie! It goes from rise to fall a perfect movie a MUST SEE DO YOU HEAR ME A MUST SEE!THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I AM THE LIZARD KING I CAN DO ANYTHING!
This movie changed my perspective of Rock n' Roll intensely.  This movie was so gratifying, it gave me chills, it also made me sort of understand Morrison more.  Val Kilmer portrayed  such a terrific roll as Morrison, I acually believed it was Morrison instead of the actor.  I love the doors.  I dont think the movie could be any better or any worse.  Thumbs up to Oliver STONE.  JIM MORRISON LIVES
This told the story about The Doors through their years up until Jim Morrison died sadly. It gave me a whole new look in the band. Val Kilmer delivers in the great role as one of the best rock and rollers of our time. The Doors have some of the best songs out there and it protrays on how some songswere written. Great DVD..Buy it! I did, It was worth the money! A++
This movie was excellent. Val Kilmer played Jim Morrison impeccably. This movie really gave me a look into The Doors and really entertained me. I'd Reccommend this movie for anyone who likes The Doors or music from that time. I enjoyed it, before the movie I didn't know too much about Jim Morrison or The Doors but now I am a Doors fan. This movie is a must-see
This overlong biopic of Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) is most interesting early on as it details the rise to fame of the Doors.  Soon, however, Morrison surrenders himself completely to drugs and the film spirals into a long series of repetitive scenes in which Morrison abuses himself and others.  The main reason to watch this film is Kilmer's incredible performance.  To impersonate a man whose look and sound are so well-known without descending into characature is a true acting achievement.  Unfortnately, writer-director Oliver Stone dotes on Morrison's sophomoric paens to death and self-centered spiritual explorations so minutely that he often comes across as an unquestioning syncophant.  The greatest narrative achievement of the film is showing how such a self-destructive person can maintain a career--at least for a while--through the efforts of those around him who feel that the talent he offers justifies the garbage they have to put up with.
Wow, I really have no idea how people can give this movie good reviews.<br /><br />The camera work is interesting, and it definitely captured the times and gave me a good sense of who Jim Morrison was (well, at least as Oliver Stone saw him), but it's not really much of a movie.<br /><br />Jim Morrison was born, he became famous, and then he died.  All of the rest of the stuff just happens for no reason, like in real life.  I have no problem with a movie being like that, but what pissed me off was Stone's usual pretentiousness in trying to make this movie "meaningful".  This movie is just about some guy's life; there's really no meaning to it.  Instead of admitting that, he sticks in indians and other weird shots as if that will make the movie deeper somehow.  It doesn't, it just looks stupid, and it tells the viewer nothing of The Doors or Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The movie was also kind of boring.  Scenes went on for way too long, and everything blended together into an incohesive mush so that whatever happened seemed unremarkable and pointless (which it was, most of the time).  I have no problem with pointless stuff, when it really adds to the characters (as in a Woody Allen movie), but here it just seemed to continue to hammer into the viewer's head the same portrait of Jim Morrison that was crystal clear around twenty minutes into the movie.  The character didn't unfold at all; it just gutted itself near the beginning and then pointed to different squishy bits for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />So thanks a lot, Oliver Stone, for ruining what could have been an interesting movie.<br /><br />The only reason I give it two stars is for the part with Andy Warhol, when he mentions that he could call God on his telephone, but he has nothing to say to him, so he gives the telephone to Jim Morrison and says "Now you can talk to God."<br /><br />How could you not love that part?
Even though this movie has been slated by critics and is considered one of Oliver Stone's turkeys, it certainly is not uneventful. I had the pleasure of first watching this film after taken over 100 dried psilocybin mushrooms and even though I would not do that again as quickly, I must say that this film was an excellent choice at the time.<p>Basically the story is that there is none expect for the rise and fall of the music legend Jim Morrison. The film starts with his boyhood memories of an Indian car accident, his early film-school days (watch for the cameo of Oliver Stone as his film professor) and the formation of the band  - The Doors, which consists of the actors Kyle Maclachlan, Kevin Dillion and Frank Whaley. Val Kilmer IS Jim Morrison and is completely believable throughout the entire film. The plot revolves around his relationship with Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan) who battles for his love and attention as Morrison takes on a God like status in the world of sex, drugs and rock n' roll. <p>Stone decides to concentrate more on Morrison's descent into self-destruction and there are plenty of tragic gigs gone wrong along the way. The film is very mystical in parts but ends up saying very little. It is more about the ups and downs (mostly downs) of a big time rock n' roll star than anything else. Wonderful camerawork though and amazing lighting. The script is somewhat weak but there is still plenty of stuff that keeps this film moving forward.<p>And yeah, it was better with the shrooms, in case you wanted to know. 4 to 5 stars with shrooms, 3 without.
The Doors - directed by Oliver Stone -  is a sad story about the 60's rock group and legend Jim Morrison, lead singer, poet and songwriter.  The movie covers the period from 1965-1971.  Val Kilmer stars as Jim Morrison, a very intelligent man who is his own worst enemy.  He cannot handle the pressures of success.  We see a slow train wreck as he turns to excesses in drugs, drink, women and exhibitionism.<br /><br />In the beginning (1965) he is going to college, but also a Southern California beach boy, writing poetry, finding his first true love.  It could be the start of Beach Blanket Bingo for that matter.  A friend helps Jim form the Doors rock group (named after the book by Aldus Huxley "The Doors of Perception")  and from there on it is a marathion of drugs, drink, egotism, confusion and despair.  Depending on how much you enjoy the 1960's counterculture will be how you view this movie.  It hypnotizes in the treadmill of drug trips, crazy outfits, California, trendy clubs, Andy Warhol parties, and outrageous behavior.<br /><br />As fabulous as Val Kilmer plays Jim Morrison, the drugged, halucinagenic excess becomes boring fast.  The opporutnity lost is that Morrison had talent with words, high intelligence, but spent it on the dark side.  Seeing this movie I am wondering if he could have been pulled from the abyss with better handlers and some on-going therapy. Morrison died in Paris at the young age of 27 and is buried in a near-by cemetery for famous artists.  Overall, the movie seemed like a long tabloid expose and I felt like this was an intrusion on the Morrison's privacy.<br /><br />It also starred Meg Ryan (as Morrison's girlfriend), and the Doors group played by Frank Whaley, Kyle MacLachlan
I should preface this by stating I really do NOT like Oliver Stone movies (other than Natural Born Killers), for some reason I feel very disconnected to them. And he does it again with the Doors. On the recommendation of my son I watched this on a borrow and I have to say I watched the entire run of the movie and still know NOTHING about THE DOORS. The movie is instead filled with psychedelic filler of the highest order and Jim Morrison comes off as nothing more than a sullen drunken crybaby.<br /><br />All the relationships seemed forced and nothing about this era or group seemed interesting at all, and I have to think that's simply not true in real life. A lot has been made of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison and for all the hype I've heard I can say I was mildly let down, which could be more a fault of the script since NO ONE not even the lead had any type of depth or worthwhile backstory, so what more can an actor do? I actually thought Meg Ryan was the stand out, and that doesn't say a lot.
The movie is interesting and I think Val Kilmer did a good job.  I rate this so low because Artisan  just put big black bars on top and bottom and then calls it widescreen.  This is FAKE widescreen and is a bad, bad, bad thing.
Even with star power there is little to like about this film, at least for anyone with any interest in it from the perspective of a historic narrative.<br /><br />The first time I saw it I was impressed at how well Kilmer did at emulating and looking like Morrison. His singing was even okay, in a way. His performances would have been passable even, if it had been a local college putting it on as a weekend theater event, but to suggest that Kilmer did a passable job at singing Morrison's parts is to admit one has either never listened much to the Doors, has a tin ear, or is already impartial to Kilmer.<br />The film would have been much better with Jim Morrison's own voice whenever possible, and much as I hate lip-synching, that's what Kilmer should have done.<br />I'm sure that it would be very hard to find any professional singers who would be impressed by the singing in this movie.<br /><br />Any doubters may want to try a little experiment - watch some of the movie tracks, then put on the Doors and listen to how much more effective, natural and musical a singer Morrison was. Better yet, find one of the many available videos of Morrison onstage and see how amateurish the impressionism of Kilmer's performance looks.<br />Now just in case anyone thinks I have a bone to pick with Kilmer; I don't. I simply find the emulation of Morrison to be very poor for a movie with the kind of budget that a maker like Stone would have had available.<br /><br />That said, I think Kilmer did a much better job on L.A. Woman than any of the other tracks, and wonder if it isn't at least partially because he was focused on the much more relaxed atmosphere of the track, rather than the weird side of Morrison he was instructed throughout to portray.<br /><br />By all accounts Jim was a strange fellow in many ways, but also anything but one-dimensional, but with Oliver Stone being so one-dimensional himself, it's impossible for him to tell any story as a passive teller. He finds it impossible to stand on the sidelines and let us know what happened. It's much more empowering for him to interject his values and agenda onto every story told, which is so much more disappointing because he tells so many important stories - always with his opinion/agenda as more important than history itself.<br /><br />They say that fact is stranger than fiction - I also find fact to be more interesting than fiction.<br /><br />When I read so many positive reviews of the movie itself and Kilmer's performance, it immediately reminds me of the Emperor and all the crowds exclaiming about his stylish new outfit. Maybe I'm only a child, because to me, the Emperor has no clothes.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks Morrison was nothing but a sick weirdo might want to listen to the Doors a little further, and some evidence of the romantic in him is very easily unveiled by listening to such tracks as Touch Me, Love Her Madly, I Can't See Your Face, Indian Summer and Blue Sunday.<br />The incredibly up-beat and positive atmosphere of Land Ho! from Morrison Hotel is very often surprising to people not completely familiar with the Doors albums in general.<br /><br />Now go check out some real Doors material!
I went to see this film the night it was released in Seattle. Not because it interested me so much but more because I had a friend who really wanted to see it when it came out and couldn't. He liked to see films immediately upon their release. I liked to do things that irked him, so I made sure to see the film before he did. This was a surprising film, really. When I heard that Val Kilmer had been cast as Jim Morrison, I, like many, was skeptical that he would be able to pull it off. The Val Kilmer we had to that point come to recognise looked nothing like Morrison in addition to which, Kilmer's roles had never really stretched his "acting muscles", so most were convinced that he would fail. However, Kilmer respectably fooled everyone with his convincing portrayal of Morrison. His performance was enjoyable. Meg Ryan was surprising also because her role was a bit of a departure. Still didn't like her, though. Kathleen Quinlan's blood drinking gothic diversion for Morrison was an interesting character. The story was not thrilling, as we all know the story, and in fact, many parts of the film were simply laughable. I noticed at the end when Morrison decides to move to Paris and is saying goodbye to his friends (other Doors members), he and the friends hug and not only do they perform that special "man hug" (which is a hug always accompanied by several hard slaps on the back... very manly) but also accompanied with tender sentiments like, "I'm gonna miss you" followed by the tempering insult, "you a**hole". No niceties for the sake of niceties. We all know Jim's fate... you can visit him in the P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery in Paris.
I RENTED THIS MOVIE ABOUT 2-3 DAYS AGO. I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCKY WHEN I FIRST SAW IT, BUT WHEN I THINK OF IT, IT WAS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS. THAT SONG "LIGHT MY FIRE." IT IS THE MOST AWESOME SONG ON THE CDs AND THE MOVIE (THE VAL KILMER VERSION IS BETTER)!  I AM A BIG FAN OF THE DOORS NOW!  THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING: SEX(LOTS OF IT!), VIOLENCE, NUDITY (LOTS OF IT!), DRUGS (LOTS), AND LANGUAGE (LOTS), COMEDY (LOTS). WELL, ALL I REALLY HAVE TO SAY IS THIS: THE DOORS IS THE BEST MUSICAL GROUP MOVIE EVER! I RECOMMEND IT!  I AM ONLY 12 YEARS OLD AND I LOVED IT! IT IS A SHOCK TO ME!  SO I RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE 12-ADULT (MAYBE A LITTLE OLDER BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE, SEX, NUDITY, AND DRUG CONTENT.)  SO SEE IT!
4 stars for Val Kilmer who fills the boots of a "lamentable wreck of a human being."  Meg Ryan belatedly caught on to the obvious fact that she was playing a part in a cautionary tale, but she caught on too late to improve her part in a sordid tragedy that grinds down from not bad to bad.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's movie is, again, Oliver Stone OD'd on purple strychnine.  He's stoned, lost in a purple haze, but is very far from immaculate.  What saves him here is what saved the lizard kingdom (until the main man, like Marat, went down for the very last time in a bathtub in Paris ... or so they say):  a powerful, insidious, incantatory sound confected by Paul Rothschild at a console in the lab.  A sound from the dead past that lights up the deadly present with flashes of holy lightning.<br /><br />Jim Morrison was pronounced dead years before he died.  He was, said the cool coroners & smiling morticians of his generation, a dime-store Rimbaud, puerile, simplistic, sophomoric.  He had been a sophomore, maybe a high school freshman, very high, who wrote about the mute nostril agony of the horse latitudes, words that seem almost perfect now, almost alive, almost evocative of our deepest secret fear.<br /><br />Like a horse in a dead sea, Morrison was pushed overboard. Kilmer catches some of the stiff green desperate gallop of a bad man, prematurely old, poising, pausing, sinking & subsiding.  Of the convenience of death at an early age.  Of a fat man sick of himself, flailing with shoulders as smooth as ravens' claws.
dated June 5, 2000, that no one has reviewed this movie from an unbiased standpoint --<p>Dude, I couldn't care less about Jim Morrison or his  &quot;doors&quot;  either way, so, rather unfortunately, I'm merely left with this movie that Oliver Stone dumped, like a pile of rubbish, on an unsuspecting world.  *The Doors*  features pretentious photography, time-lapse photography, jump-cut photography, murky photography, and downright MTV-inspired photography.  Stone even uses a Steadicam at various points, for Pete's sake.  The results are ugly, to be frank. <p>But forget all that; that's technical stuff, and may be overlooked as long as the subject matter is worth watching.  I'm afraid that Stone failed to make his case, here.  The question before the Court is:  &quot;Was a movie about Jim Morrison entirely necessary?&quot;  This movie, as evidence, would fail to convict.  Stone is preaching to a converted audience, presumably; an audience that knows all the ins and outs of the rock star's career, and he  (Stone)  expects us to fill in the blanks.  Hey, all I knew for sure about the guy is that he sang a song called  *Light My Fire*  in which he sounded rather like a Sinatra gone literally to pot.  The other reviwers here at Amazon assure me that Morrison was a serious Poet; that he was fearsomely well-read; that he should be regarded as an artist.  Well, in the first place, if he had been a REAL artist, he would now be recognized as such by critics -- so far, that notice has failed to occur.  Secondly, *The Doors*  does nothing to prove Morrison's artistic cred.  At any rate, we're offered a series of tawdry scenes where a celebrity behaves like . . . well, a celebrity.  That's simply not enough dramatic juice to keep me interested for 2+ hours.  Sorry.
this movie is hogwash. oliver stone blew it with this one.With subject matter as the doors a really good film could have been made. its filled wth inaccurate information ie jim didnt quit film school stone did! the surviving Doors in documentaries state that stone missed the boat, morrison had addictions he also was talented but by the look of this film you would never be able to tell. Val kilmer does look and sound alittle like jim morrison but he never seems to let us want to  care anything about him or his art.the movie is a mixed up mess "IS EVERYBODY IN" Gee i hope not!
be serious: Val Kimler playing Jim Morrison?  Oh, be real.  Oliver must've been WAY stoned.  But instead of being so negative, here's an idea:  how 'bout a "two CD-set" of...um...say, "Helter Skelter" with Pee Wee Herman portraying Charles Manson?  And then you could drag out J Lo to play Squeaky Fromme, and keep the "reality" in high gear, eh?
Oliver Stone, a great director in general, really slacks off in this one! I understand Kilmer as a choice for Morrison but, Meg Ryan as Pam...only in a dream world.All the dates and many facts were either wrong or excluded.  Stone even turned to making things up to fill time and help move the story  along. All in all a very good story but, not nearly an accurate depiction  of Jims' rise and fall
As in Oliver Stone's &quot;Nixon&quot; and &quot;JFK&quot;, the director lards his rockumentary with large chunks of fiction.  It's not surprising that Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek found this film so objectionable.  How would you feel if thousands of people were seeing a movie about you that was mostly untrue, and cast you in a bad light?<p>Still, as long as you accept that this is a dramatization of how one person perceives the Doors and their music, this is an enjoyable film, made worthwhile especially by Val Kilmer's uncanny impersonation of Jim Morrison.  Stone's quasi-surrealistic approach evokes the time and place and seems particularly well suited to the inner world of Doors music.<p>A major objection is the emphasis on Morrison as a drunken, obnoxious lout.  This side of Morrison is an easy target for a film maker, but it's hardly an accurate portrayal.  I strongly recommend The Doors Collection DVD, which will give you a glimpse of Morrison's sensitive side.  Also Manzarek's memoir &quot;Light My Fire&quot; will balance the picture for you.<p>Although the listing here says that this is an anamorphic transfer, according to information on other web sites this is NOT ANAMORPHIC, but is the same transfer used in the previous DVD release (and the laserdisc).  It's nice to have the extras, but early reviews indicate that this is a particularly low quality transfer, and I'd prefer to hold out for a new anamorphic release.  (The first Doors audio CDs were of very poor quality and were quietly remastered and reissued about four years later; hopefully this film will get the DVD treatment it deserves.)
This is Oliver Stone's best film, Val Kilmer's best performance, and the 2d best fiction film representation of a rock band (This Is Spinal Tap is the best, of course). But first, the bad news:<br />Stone's miscogyny nearly sinks the film. Morrison's significant other,Pamela Courson, was by all accounts, a tough as nails hippy chick who had the measure of her man. Jim was as devoted to her as he could be to a woman, and while both strayed often, they always came back to each other. Doors songs memorializing their relationship, like "Queen of the Highway," are a window into what Ray Manzarek termed a great love story. In the film, poor Meg Ryan (an excellent physical match for Pam) plays her as a nagging whiny scold, always trying to stop our hero from doing whatever it is a man's gotta do. Nothing could have been further from the truth, as Pam's refusal to put Jim on a leash was what kept them together. Her character is intolerable in the flick, just like Sissy Spacek's performance as Jim Garrison's wife in JFK and Daryl Hannah's in Wall Street, and is likely more representative of Stone's relationships with sundry long-suffering ex-wives than Pam and Jim.  Stone's miscogny rears its ugly head again in his slander of Nico, the ethereal, brilliant ice goddess, here depicted as a balloon-breasted nekkid bimbo. Ugh.<br />These 2 dead women are sadly not around to kick Stone's butt for the injustice committed herein.<br />Second: for a movie called "The Doors," Robby Krieger, John Densmore, and Ray Manzarek are relegated to the background of the film. Morrison deferred to them in all matters artistic, and in return they provided him with a splendid musical carpet, backing his every unpredictable move every step of the way. While the film does justice to the music, it barely acknowledges the contribution of the musicians, without whom Morrison knew and acknowledged he was nothing. Character-wise, they seem like low-key versions of Pam, bemused and upset by Jim's antics where I suspect in real life they were enablers and facilitors and collaborators.<br /><br />Now the good: perhaps because and not in spite of the fact Stone was stuck in the jungles of Vietnam while this story was being played out, as an imaginative re-creation of The Summer of Love and its dark aftermath, this film is nonpareil. Every detail of decor and costume, every location, seems dead-on accurate. [except for the fact that the women who pack the gigs look like they just tumbled off a casting couch...] I think Stone relished making up for the '60's he missed, and threw himself into the project with discipline and love. (Think of this as the homefront story playing out behind Platoon and Born on the 4th of July...)The concert scenes are phenomenal, orchestrated chaos spiraling out of control, while the ring-leader looks on with a bemused, ironic detatchment, not quite knowing what to make of the mindless Dionysian energies he has un-leashed in his audience.<br />Morrison speaks to Stone: both are products of the counterculture gestalt, both are artists who mix vast talent with vast pretension, excess, bombast, a boatload of drugs, and macho nonsense in equal measure. Stone's aesthetic failings are also Morrison's (great pop star/wretched poet), so the weaknesses of the film don't really hurt the movie, they make it seem more true to Mr Mojo Risin's messed up genius.<br />Finally -- Val Kilmer. This performance/incarnation is flat-out uncanny. Beyond capturing the obvious -- the looks, the voice, the stance, the charisma -- Kilmer also catches the irony and anti-star compulsions; his bemused role-playing when he poses for cheesecake photos for the cover of 16 magazine, his desire to shake up his audience by all the means at his disposal, his willful physical degeneration, pulling the plug on his Pop Star persona by turning himself into a tubby bearded wino/bluesman in record time. Kilmer never lets us forget Morrison was something of a clown, waiting and watching to see what would happen next when he ventured out further on the edge, appreciating the absurdity of the endeavor. Kilmer's sense of humor and self-mockery is what saves the movie from pretension, as it ultimately saves Morrison's art.<br /><br />Formally, this movie initiated the chaotic visual style, expressionist psychedelic agit-prop, which Stone brought to fruition in subsequent films like JFK, Natural Born Killers, and Nixon. The film seems to careen out of control, but Stone's hand is firmly on the tiller. By the time we get to the legendary Miami concert that basically ended the band's career, with Kilmer/Morrison exhorting his equally whacked-out audience to follow him all the way, but clueless as to the destination, the swirling disembodied camera, perfectly re-created music, and wild montage really puts us in the heart of an epoch long past -- I really felt like i was there. Warts and all, a classic.
The Doors<br /><br />Some reviewers seem annoyed that the film is actually about Jim Morrison and not about The Doors.  And it's true.  The band seems like a canvas upon which Jim Morrison can sing, act out, drink, and otherwise remain perpetually painted at the forefront of this film.  Oliver Stone's camera is enamored with Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison.  And Kilmer's performance is quite exciting, indeed.  But I wonder why Stone lets Kilmer steal the entire movie.  Where are The Doors?  Where's the history of the band?  The movie suggests that The Doors revolve entirely around Morrison and that the stories of the other band members, while likely less crazy and sensational, are not at all interesting without Morrison's presence and influence.<br /><br />I think the tragedy of Jim Morrison's life is that he actually believed that drugs, sex, and alcohol - mixed with a soul trapped by societal conventions - somehow opens the artist to the infinite beauty of the universe.  But really, it's pain that drives all good art.  Morrison writes, speaks, and sings of his poor relationship with his parents.  He sought the convention of a happy family by desensitizing himself rather than facing his fear of utter abandonment honestly and soberly.  It's this pain that makes Morrison somewhat sympathetic.  Despite his determination to live as an alcoholic drug addict, some pain seeped out, taking the forms of poetry, film, and music.<br /><br />Perhaps psychoanalyzing Morrison is too easy, but we aren't given much else from Stone and Kilmer.  Whenever Morrison appears drunken and aggressive in front of the band, watch the faces of the band members.  They know exactly what's wrong with Morrison as they fight the futile battle of getting Morrison sober enough to sing another song.
Oliver Stone's portrayal of the Doors and Jim Morrison is extreme and in many cases untrue and exaggerated.  He takes the events of the Doors and binds them into cliche rock band problems that never happened.  The UCLA  film by Jim Morrison was never that extreme, and there were a lot more  inaccuracies in the movie.  If you want a true account of the Doors, read  Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek.
Calling this movie "The Doors" is misleading. It would be more accurate to call it "Jim Morrison and Those Other Guys In the Band," since that is how it's presented.<br /><br />It's always tempting to latch onto a rock legend in these rock biopics, and Oliver Stone clings like a limpet to the ghost of Jim Morrison. Acid-soaked scenery and mysticism are in every scene, but Stone seems content to wallow in the rock'n'roll debauchery rather than get into Morrison's head.<br /><br />It opens with a voiceover of Jim Morrison's poetry, as we slowly fade into a stalled recording session. Then it flips back to 1949, as Morrison's family drives through the desert. The boy catches a glimpse of several Indians by the road -- and one of them dies as the family leaves.<br /><br />Then it flips ahead to Morrison's (Val Kilmer) years at college -- he crashes a party for a pretty girl, makes arty films, acid-trips, and devotes himself to poetry. Then his pal Ray Manzarek (Kyle McLachlan) creates a rock band, with Morrison's poetry and voice as the centerpiece. Soon The Doors become a fixture in L.A. -- and then a famed band.<br /><br />But as the Doors become more famous, Morrison increasingly loses himself in the messianic-Dionysian-rocker role that has been set out for him. He weds a witch-journalist (Katherine Quinlan) but loves his fey girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). And when he outrages the authorities with the threat of public exposure, the spiral starts that will only lead to death.<br /><br />Stone certainly knew how to evoke the golden ages of rock'n'roll. Lots of sex, kinetic concerts, and bizarre behavior where Morrison jumps up on platforms and screams, "I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!" The whole movie just kind of sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />And Stone is quite brilliant with the direction. The movie is filmed like an acid trip -- shifting multicoloured skies, Indian ghosts, shadows on the sand, and eerie lighting. And it touches on other aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic. The other Doors are relegated to a frame for Morrison's bizarre behavior, and after the first half hour, they basically fade away. And he gets too enamored of his own style with the Indian ghost, and the arty "dead man" final scenes.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a shockingly good job with the languid, unpredictable energy of Morrison. He sings well too. Sadly, his performance is stuck in a one-note character -- Stone opts to potray him just as a random, sleazy, wild jerk, and we don't get a single insight into his thoughts. Sure, Morrison could be horrible. But this is Jim Morrison as rock cliche, not as a human being.<br /><br />And sadly, none of the other actors get much chance to expand on their roles -- the other Doors actors, including MacLachlan, basically play slightly annoyed accessories, and Meg Ryan plays a sweet girl without many other dimensions. Although Crispin Glover has a tiny, memorable role as Andy Warhol.<br /><br />"The Doors" opens into a beautiful psychedelic movie, but Stone fails to give it a soul. It's a fun biopic full of the sixties atmosphere, but it never quite manages to be much more.
The movie is amazing..Val Kilmer deserved an Oscar for his roles..Maybe the best acting role in the 1990s.<br /><br />Ok..The DVD 2 disk special edition..You'd expect the movie to be a proper transfer..Heck, the put released it with 2 DVDs..NOPE..<br /><br />It is in widescreen letterbox 2.35:1..BUT it is so small that it's a little bot in the center of the screen(bars on the top, bottom, right, and left...big ones)..You need to use the zoom function...or the cinema function on your TV to make it full screen letter box 2.35:1<br /><br />In doing this..it greatly reduces the video quality...WOW..I was shocked.<br /><br />I've only encountered this ONE OTHER TIME on a straight to video junk movie from Netflix a year or more ago..I've never seen this codec used..it is like it was made for use in a video ipod.<br /><br />I have "Gladiator" Extended edition with both Theatrical and Extended on one DVD..Same with "Apocalypse Now Redux" so it isn't a size limitation as both those films fit on a dual layer DVD..<br /><br />I do not understand why they would do this..Maybe Hollywood does truly hate Oliver Stone
This film somewhat disappointed me. I walked away from this film thinking that Jim Morrison was an alcoholic jerk who cared only about himself. Thankfully, soon after watching this movie I read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' and I have come to see a better picture of the true Jim Morrison.<br /><br />It seems as if Hollywood is only interested in the abusive side of Morrison and not the more down-to-earth side of Morrison. Oliver Stone made Jim's character so one dimensional... and this is a serious flaw in a movie that is based, for the mostpart, on one man.<br /><br />That being said, Val Kilmer plays a GREAT Jim Morrison. The movie has many fantastic parts: the making of 'Light My Fire', the cinematography in Jim's desert peyote scene, the Miami concert.<br /><br />It is a great film to watch, but definitely read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' if you want to understand the more human side of Jim Morrison.<br /><br />4/5
Surely Jim Morrison's life wasn't as debauched as Oliver Stone presents it in THE DOORS (1991). The film plays like a rock music gang bang. OK, not exactly, but if Jimmy was THAT physically active wouldn't he have had a case of terminal johnson blisters?<br /><br />Recently seeing this movie again reminded me of how handsome Val Kilmer was in his youth. Physically he makes a superb Morrison, can even sing like the man. Yes, the music is just great here and the actors playing the other members of the Doors work well in their roles.<br /><br />Crispin Glover's Andy Warhol is also interesting (in a creepy sort of way), but this film is good only up to a point. The early story works best, and then you get to that vampire sequence, geez. And how about Meg Ryan's elevator surprise? If I saw what she encountered that night I'd be outta there on the next flight to San Berdoo. Yet Pamela Courson stuck around for more heartbreak, and more, and more, and...<br /><br />Director Stone must have a message here. Surely it isn't: don't shoot too many scenes with a red filter? With Morrison/Kilmer overdrugging, overdrinking, oversexing, overeating and overschmoozing, it has to be: all things in moderation.<br /><br />In a two year period, Janis Joplin died of heroin and booze, Jim Morrison passed away in a bathtub from a heroin OD and Jimi Hendrix asphixiated while regurgitating the 9 sleeping pills he'd swallowed, which apparently was 8 too many. All were only 27. All had made wondrous music. The word "tragedy" doesn't begin to describe how Janis, Jim and Jimi left us, and what the world lost in potential new songs as a result. Their deaths marked a turning point in music and in how we fans lived our own lives.<br /><br />Epilogue: Three years after Jim left her, Pamela Courson also died of a heroin overdose. Like the others, Pamela was only 27 years old.
I picked up this 2 disc 15th anniversary edition (THE ONE WITH THE PURPLE COVER) a couple years ago when it was being blown out new for $6 & just got around to watching it. It's one of those ultra wide & short wide screens, & it seems to me that the tops of people's heads are frequently cut off; I'm wondering if Lions Gate messed up on the aspect ratio during mastering as has happened with a few other films. I no longer have the original version to compare it with, but I strongly suspect this was messed up.
I think The Doors are one of the greatest bands in rock history. I also think that no one else will ever possess the presence or talent that Jim Morrison did,especially with the way rock "music" is going these days (I mean, Limp Bizkit was popular a few years ago, if that says anything about where rock is headed.)<br />I'm not an Oliver Stone fan particularly. I've never seen JFK, and Natural Born Killers seems to have a sort of following behind it, but I honestly didn't see any redeeming qualities about that movie. So when I saw that Oliver Stone was the director of the movie about my favorite band, although I was excited to watch it, I truthfully wasn't expecting very much.<br />I bought it before watching it and still own it. Although I've seen it many times, I'm still conflicted as to how I feel about it. It seems that the movie, although true to The Doors and how they got together and their rise to fame, did not do Jim justice at all. It had nothing to do with Val Kilmer, he was perfect as Jim, especially the live performance scenes; I've watched many Doors live performances and how Val embodied Jim in that respect was really amazing. I do think he over-did it sometimes-the pouty thing he did drove me nuts and the photo shoot scene made me laugh it was so cheesy. All in all though, I loved Val as Jim. Yet the movie seemed to show only one aspect of who Morrison was-on the road to excess, out of control, drunken, womanizing. Sure he's a rock star, but I would have loved to know more about who he REALLY was, because I feel the movie didn't delve into that. I'm positive there was much more to him than the drunken rock star (even if it was the truth, that's not all of who he was). Ray Manzarek said it best "It was not about Jim Morrison. It was about Jimbo Morrison, the drunk. God, where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy? The guy I knew was not on that screen."<br />I give the movie three stars because aside from my criticisms of it, it's essentially a good movie by an okay director about an amazing band. Damn you Oliver Stone, why couldn't a better director with a better screenplay have done this movie, who knows what could have been.
"The Doors" is the greatest of all rock movies, in the years since it was first released in 1991 it has gained a weird kind of cult status, it is popular among young rockers and teenagers as it is among the adults who belong to the generation first grabbed by "Light My Fire." The film is directed by cinema madman and virtuoso, Oliver Stone, who was a Doors fan when serving in Vietnam and here conceives a movie that is big in scope and excess, in other words, it stays true to the spirit of it's subject. People (including Doors organist Ray Manzarek) have attacked Stone and movie for dramatic license and fictional inventions, but the Morrison myth has grown so large that it is hard to even trust the accounts of people like Manzarek (who enjoys pouring gasoline into the myth's fire) and so the movie should be taken for what it is, a MOVIE. And man, it is one of the great rock spectacles ever dramatized on film. Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance, dressed in the black leather pants and long hair, he gives a stunning performance because we never doubt it is Jim Morrison dancing around on the screen, the effect is even more enhanced because Kilmer sang most of the concert scenes (in the DVD commentary, Stone informs us Kilmer sang ALL of the 1969 Miami concert sequence) and as a performer, he has a pretty good voice. The movie captures not only the madness of Morrison, but also the atmosphere and lore of his music. The movie uses no score, it imploys the Doors songs to create the mood (while squeezing in "Venus In Furs" by Velvet Underground and the classic opus "Carmina Burana"). There are moments of insansity and excess that create a hypnotic intensity driven by the rich, dreamy photography by Robert Richardson, and there are even, amidst the sex, drugs and rock n' roll, some moments of romantic sweetness in a poetic way when Morrison rhymes for his girl Pamela Courson (played by Meg Ryan). Stone used completely live audiences for the concert sequences, which are exhilarating and stunning, especially a gothic sequence in San Francisco when the band performs "Not To Touch The Earth." Any Doors fan will love this film, especially since the soundtrack, featuring all the greats like "Break On Through," "Backdoor Man," "Light My Fire," "Strange Days," "The Crystal Ship" and "Five To One" pulses with the Doors sound, and hearing Kilmer deliver his own performances is a treat no Doors afficionado or rock enthusiast should miss. "The Doors" is thrilling, hypnotic and a fiery experience of great rock n' roll.
I avoided this movie when it first came out, and I avoided it for about 10 years afterward, because I heard that it was such a travesty. Recently, I received the DVD as a Christmas gift. Out of respect to the person who gave it to me, I decided to watch it at least once. I was very pleasantly surprised... and physically and emotionally exhausted by the movie's end. True, Oliver Stone's version of the Doors' legend isn't dead-on accurate, but I think the realism and accuracy were only sacrificed in order to make a greater visceral and artistic impact, which I believe is something Jim Morrison might have understood. The whole point of this movie is to revel in its excesses, and on that point, the movie scores everytime. And remember that this is the story as filtered through Stone's own perception, not a docudrama. Kudos to Val Kilmer, whose portrayal of Jim Morrison was just as uncanny as I'd heard. (Where's his Oscar?) I really dug this movie, even as a Doors fan who knows the true history as heard from the band. And if you can experience it as the Bacchanalian epic it's meant to be, and just take in all the sights and sounds, then you'll really dig it, too.
Val Kilmer's extraordinary portrayl of rock legend Jim Morrison is timeless. The film has progressively become a cult classic because of it's chaotic yet introspective tale concerning The Doors and Morrison's rise as a legend.
I was not a big fan of "The Doors" musical group until I watched this film. I feel Val Kilmer did an incredible performance as Jim Morrison. To learn later that Mr Kilmer actually sang most of the songs in the film himself, blew me away. I feel this film was before it's time. And Mr Kilmer should have been nominated for the performance. They nominated that actor for "Ray" and he did not even sing in the movie. I gave this movie 5 stars, for all the incredible acting done in this film especially Val Kilmer & Meg Ryan.
This movie is a very insightful look into the Doors and Jim Morrison's life. However, if you really want an accurate history I would read Riders on the Storm by John Densmore.
I first saw this movie in my high school film studies class.  It blew my mind.<br /><br />The Doors were one of the biggest acts of the late '60s and early '70s.  Val Kilmer is brilliant as Jim Morrison.  He's got the look, the sound, and the feel down pat.  Jim was a bit of a wild man during this psychedelic era, and the movie totally reflects that -- excessive drugs, wild antics on and off stage, etc.  One of my favorite scenes is when The Doors are invited to play on The Ed Sullivan Show and are asked to censor "Light My Fire."  They don't, and Val exaggerates the moment way beyond what actually happened.  A classic scene.<br /><br />There are a few inaccuracies in the film which knocks my rating down one star.  I learned about them in Ray Manzarek's book, "Light My Fire:  My Life With The Doors."  Apparently, Jim Morrison did graduate UCLA; he did not quit, as shown in this movie.<br /><br />Still, as exaggerated as some parts are, that's what good filmmaking is all about.  Buckle up for a wild journey through time with The Doors.  Is everybody in?
Oliver Stone's and we all know about him, rendition of a quasi biography of an influential 1960's rock band. We are treated to behind the scene understanding of what makes Jim Morrison, Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The movie dragged on and on and on with psychedelic filler. Most of the actors were sleepwalking through the script, especially Meg Ryan and Val Kilmer.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006L929">Doors - Soundstage Performances</a>
I am not a "diehard fan" of The Doors, though I do appreciate their work.  I do believe that all the actors who play the band-members do a superb job... But my positive comments stop there.<br /><br />The director, Oliver Stone, fills this movie with so many drug-induced hallucinations, you cannot tell if a scene is something that actually happened or if it's the work of Morrison's drugged-up imagination.  Now, I don't like your run-of-the-mill biopic, but this unconventional biopic wallows in self-indulgence to the point of absurdity.  Stone and the producers seem so determined to make this more of an "art film" than an actual biopic, and, boy, does it back-fire.  Granted, every biopic is "Hollywood-ized", but this movie makes you wonder way too many times where the artistic license ends and the actual facts begin or vice-versa.<br /><br />In short, this production showcases the leader of a rock-band - Jim Morrison - who is bent on self-destruction.  The same could be said about this movie.
Myself, being a huge doors fan, I absolutely love this movie. Oliver Stone did a great job capturing Jim Morrison's wild life fueled by drugs and alcohol onto the big screen, but maybe he gave us a false perception of the Lizard King. Many people watch this movie to get an idea on what Jim was like, and this movie is not what it's for. Oliver Stone exaggerated a lot of thing in Jim's life to make it more movie like, which is completely okay, but people must understand this.<br /><br />As a movie, it's fantastic, and keeps us pulled into Jim's story throughout the whole thing, but don't look at this movie as a documentary.
...its still just a movie. and i dont feel this portrays Jim Morrison accuratly enuff or deep enuff. But it shows the side that most people percieve i think, and it isnt a bad movie, just should be watched in fun...if you really wanna know this band, get their albums, read jims poetry and maybe find a good biography book of him.<br /><br /> This movie has been critised on here for being more about Jim than about the rest of the band as a whole, but thats becouse again, its portraying the casual listeners perception of the band...they only like Jim Morrison, cuz he looks sexy and the music was cool....and those other guys just happened to be in the band....and the movie is conscious of this and theres scenes where people try to exploit Jim and tell him to lose the other guys. And even a photographer tells Jim that its all about him, that everyone just loves him, that hes the doors.<br /><br />So its not like the movie is decieved and lieing to us, its just showing the more so the MYTH that was Morrison...not the man, who is far more interesting to me than the whats shown in this film.<br /><br />This movie didnt ruin or spoil my outlook on the band or Jim Morrison.<br />Ive grown up hearing and respecting the doors and know what very well done music theyve produced besides radio hits, so my appreciation isnt clouded by this little film.<br /><br />I think its fun to watch. I dont know if i will ever watch it again, but it just makes me wanna delve into who Jim really was and into The Doors music even more, cuz i know they were far more than this mere movie, which still pays ok tribute to the band and the singer.<br /><br />This movie still doesnt quench a thirst or curb my appetite for learning more about the Doors and Morrison, its more like a little appetiser, if anything.<br /><br />I wouldnt watch this movie as if it were a documentary...it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It doesnt possiably sum up what the Doors were as a band, or who Jim was , as a man.<br /><br />Again...it has fun portraying the MYTH.... not the man, or should i say, men. Cuz all the guys in the band made this movie possiable. Jim alone, wouldnt of amounted to anything i dont think, without the other gifted musicians he was privied to have met.<br /><br /> I like how ya get to see Jim first starting out, and meeting his future girlfriend Pam and his future band mates.... its nothing all that deep, how it unfolds, but its kinda interesting.<br /><br />Its more so a movie for casual listeners of the Doors, or for fans that just wanna take a pretend look out how it might of been in the life of Jim and the other Doors members, just to see the story come to life in some way.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a decent job playing Jim i think, but he only nails that mythic "rock God" thing...i wish the movie showed more of his comtemplative thoughtfull side, but it scratches the surface i think. But for a hollywood movie, what do you expect...they still did a good job keeping it entertaining for mass appeal and creating a cool little tribute to the man and band.<br /><br />Again, this is not the best example of learning or appreciating The Doors, let alone their singer...but its kinda fun and interesting.
This was an excellent movie if you want to learn about how the Doors got their start and became famous.  It was kind of shocking how much Jim Morrison changed throughout the movie.  It also showed how much he loved and cared for his girlfriend.  You see the Doors working in the studio and them playing in concert.  You will be surprised what some of the stuff that Jim did on stage, he screamed at the croud and said some bad stuff.  But overall I would say that it was a great movie and strongly recommend it to fans of the Doors and even people who are not fans of them.  It made me like them more because it gives you a chance to actually really listen to the music.
This is the best rock movie ever made. Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time. This is a film he gets less credit for, but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done. First of all, he nails the life of Jim Morrison, the story of The Doors, and the L.A. Scene (1960s) as perfectly as it can be done. It is beyond nostalgoia, it is time travel.<p>As great as Stone's use of Doors songs, scenery, drug use and beautiful, heavily-decorated '60s California girls is, it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest. Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks.<p>Next on the agenda, you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on, irritating Ray Manzarek. To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors, everything is flawless. The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene, particularly Morrison urinating at Barney's Beanery, which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe.<p>The feeling watching &quot;The Doors&quot; switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led, and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it.<p>Love my girl!<p>STEVEN TRAVERS<br />AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<br />...
I must say Oliver Stone and his company did a great job of recreating the atmosphere of the late 1960s.The film looks like a sixties movie.Val Kilmer was the perfect choice for the role of Jim Morrison.Though some of it was rather exagerrated,like the scene where the band performs on The Ed Sullivan Show.Ed had forbid Jim to say&quot;higher&quot;in the song Light My Fire,and Jim said it with an emphasized expression.I've got the actual episode of The Ed Sullivan Show taped.The real Jim did disobeye Ed by saying&quot;higher&quot;,but without the emphasized expression.Meg Ryan does a good portrayal of Pamela Courson too.
Oliver Stone has a creative imagination and uses it well in this biography of the legendary '60's rock band &quot;The Doors&quot;. Unfortunately, Stone forgets that most of the people portrayed in this movie are still very much alive and have a much better memory than he does! The music is fantastic, Val Kilmer is pretty good as the legendary Jim Morrison (a little too pretty maybe as Morrison always looked a little rough around the edges!) but I hope nobody leaves this movie thinking this is how it was. Buy &quot;The Doors: VH1 Storytellers&quot; to get a hint of what this band was about!
What can I say about "The Doors" that hasn't been said already. First of all Val Kilmer was so good in this movie that when I hear a Door's song I picture him instead of Jim Morrison. I wished I was born in the 50's so I could have seen The Doors.  Oliver Stone dipicts Morrison as a poet trapped in a rock star's body. The epic rise and fall of the Doors is great but sad at the same time. They had so much more to offer us. Remember people the Doors were only around for 5 years. Until Morrison's untimely death. The rest of the Doors are protrayed as innocent bystanders. John Densmore was pissing me off with his constent whining and crying. Robby Krieger was a cool guy, and Ray Manzarek was supercool. All these guys look like people that could have gone to high school with. The film has a nostaglic feeling to it, almost as if is a dockumentary rather than a film. Every time I see "The Doors" it feels as if its the first time.
THE DOORS is a great movie but I would have giving it 5 stars but if movie was based on real accounts. For one instant Jim didn't quit film school he actually graduated and made a couple of films but thats all I will say about that aspect. The movie was excellent, the acting was great espically the actors who played The Doors were excellent. This is one of those "semi-Biographical" flicks done right, I mean the doors in the movie actually look like the real doors. I thought Val Kilmer did a excellent job playing Morrison, he looked and sounded like him. Of course the soundtrack is excellent cause most of it is Doors music. If your aren't a Doors fan or just becoming one then I highly recommend it.<p>THE DVD: The DVD is alright, The only thing I didn't like about the DVD was it was a reprint of the laserdisc version of it. Besides for the deleted scenes and orignal featurette I was kinda of hoping for a new documentary on the movie. Other than that the picture and sound is great. If you enjoyed this movie then its a must to own on DVD.
I think this is a great movie and Val Kilmer did an AMAZING job, the way he was able to change himself through this movie from a younger jim, to an older one, was unreal. Meg Ryan also great in this. The music, acting, the story was very entertaining, this is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time.<p>Great Job Kilmer!
I think some of the people who wrote some of these other reviews may have had some pretty high expectations of what the film would accomplish. No, it doesn't definitively depict the life and times of the band. Yes, it focuses  primarily on the self-destruction of James D. Morrison. Yes, it's one-sided  (blame the Coursons for that). So what? Get it for the concert scenes  alone, and Val Kilmer's ininmitable performance as Morrison. I'd recommend  reading &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; by drummer John Densmore (either  before or after seeing the film) to get an idea of what Oliver Stone was  getting at (and also to appreciate the cameo appearances by the likes of  Patricia Kenealy and Densmore himself as &quot;Last Session Sound  Engineer&quot;). Bets of all, get one of the concert videos and check out  the real deal.
As a huge Morrison fan, I have to give Oliver Stone credit for being one the major influences. This isn't supposed to portray The Doors accurately-it's Hollywood, not a documentary. It's merely one person's vision with theatrics thrown in for good measure. That being said, if you love absolute and utter chaos (as I do) in rock and roll format, this is a must-see.
Ok, I don't care what most people say, this movie is probably 75% or more true than what has been said.  Sure there are a lot of inconsistencies (Such as the New Haven Incident being pegged for 1968 when it was 1967) and charachter mistakes (Patricia Keneally was not backstage in Miami..Morrison didn't meet Pam on the street etc..) but for the most part the actual events such as the New Haven Arrest, Miami, The Whiskey, and to some extent Ed Sullivan are depicted fairly accurately (At the very LEAST a little overdramatized).  I also have noticed that Oliver Stone did a lot of consolidation in this movie (Why not? I mean c'mon you can't sum up the entire Doors Legacy with a 2 hour movie!)but he did it for the most part accurately.  Before passing judgement on this movie read the books (I Highly recommend 'Riders On The Storm' by John Densmore, 'Jim Morrison: Life Death, Legend' by Stephen Davis and 'No One Here Gets Out Alive') the books will paint a picture in your mind before you watch the movie and then you can compare the two, you will find that Oliver Stone, considering the circumstances he was up against did a great job with depicting Jim Morrison and The Doors. Sure, its in no way a complete accurate representation of 'The Doors' but instead it is what Oliver Stone has made them out to be based on talking to the band and the transcripts he's read that were based on those who knew the band and/or Jim Morrison well.  Also, keep in mind, this movie is not meant to be a documentary...its an artists recreation of that era from his own perspective.
Along with The Crow, and Fight Club, this film would stand as one of my all time favourites. I have read many a novel on Jim, and own all of his albums, hence I could be a little biased on the actual filming merit of the  movie, however to me, it is a striking portrayal of perhaps one of the most  chrismatic and interesting artists of history. One of the main themes of  the movie, and something that remains unknown to many of the band fans, is  that Jim was really a poet (seen by his great spoken album American  Prayer), not a rockstar, and this is a contributing factor to his eventual  downfall, his need to play the part of a singer. This film can be  confrontingly vivid and somewhat shocking, and although it does contain  several untruths regarding the events that surrounded Jim, I believe it is  an excellent portrayal of his personality. Many would disagree, however few  could argue that the those that hate Jim and the Doors with a passion,  after seeing this film, would be slightly entrigued about Jim Morrison.
It's hard to believe that The Doors (1991) is now twenty years old.  It's also hard to believe Jim Morrison has been gone 40 years already.  Time flies.  This movie was made by the always controversial Oliver Stone.  This movie basically centers around the wild lifestyle of lead singer Jim Morrison.<br /><br />Val Kilmer gives a great performance as Jim Morrison.  I don't think any other actor could have done better.  Kyle MacLachlan is also great as keyboardist Ray Manzarek.  Frank Whaley does well as guitarist Robbie Krieger, and Kevin Dillon does a good job as drummer John Densmore.  Meg Ryan is a good Pamela Courson (Morrison's girlfriend).  Kathleen Quinlan is great as Patricia Kennealy (Morrison's mistress).  Look for cameo appearances by Paul Rothschild (the band's producer) and John Densmore.  Also look for Billy Idol, who plays Cat.<br /><br />A lot of things that occur in this movie either never happened, or if they did, were greatly exaggerated.  Keyboardist Ray Manzarek has been quoted many times as saying that certain incidents in the movie never happened, such as the Thanksgiving scene, the exaggerated performance of Light My Fire on The Ed Sullivan Show, etc.  There are also some factual errors in the movie.<br /><br />One thing I don't like about this movie is the fact that Oliver Stone portrayed Jim Morrison as a self-centered out of control drunk.  He exaggerated everything, which is typical of Stone.  I've read lots of books on Morrison and The Doors going back to the early 1980s and watched many videos/documentaries.  Morrison had a sense of humor that was absent in the movie.  He was very cerebral as well.  He wasn't wild ALL the time, but he was a great deal of the time.  Early in the movie all four band members vow to stick together, support each other no matter what, and do everything unanimously, but as the movie progresses, Manzarek, Densmore, and Krieger increasingly turn against Morrison as Morrison's behavior gets more and more out of control.  I found this interesting but understandable, because when one of the band members is totally out of control, the band can't do everything unanimously and without conflict.  This is the result of Oliver Stone choosing to portray Morrison as TOTALLY out of control.  Stone should have taken the middle road when portraying Morrison, wild but not TOO wild, but his goal is to entertain the movie audience by exaggerating things.<br /><br />I saw Ray Manzarek perform live, by himself, at Pine Knob Music Theater in Clarkston, MI in July 2002.  I'll tell you, it was one of the best performances I've ever seen at a concert venue, even though it was just Manzarek and a keyboard on stage.  The other artists there that night were Vanilla Fudge and Jefferson Starship.  Jefferson Starship gave an absolutely terrible performance, with sound problems and no Grace Slick.  It was the worst concert I've ever seen.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie that will take you to the hippie generation of 1960s America and allow you to see the story (flaws and all) of one of the great rock bands of all time.
Some reviewers seem annoyed that the film is actually about Jim Morrison and not about The Doors.  And it's true.  The band seems like a canvas upon which Jim Morrison can sing, act out, drink, and otherwise remain perpetually painted at the forefront of this film.  Oliver Stone's camera is enamored with Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison.  And Kilmer's performance is quite exciting, indeed.  But I wonder why Stone lets Kilmer steal the entire movie.  Where are The Doors?  Where's the history of the band?  The movie suggests that The Doors revolve entirely around Morrison and that the stories of the other band members, while likely less crazy and sensational, are not at all interesting without Morrison's presence and influence.<br /><br />I think the tragedy of Jim Morrison's life is that he actually believed that drugs, sex, and alcohol - mixed with a soul trapped by societal conventions - somehow opens the artist to the infinite beauty of the universe.  But really, it's pain that drives all good art.  Morrison writes, speaks, and sings of his poor relationship with his parents.  He sought the convention of a happy family by desensitizing himself rather than facing his fear of utter abandonment honestly and soberly.  It's this pain that makes Morrison somewhat sympathetic.  Despite his determination to live as an alcoholic drug addict, some pain seeped out, taking the forms of poetry, film, and music.<br /><br />Perhaps psychoanalyzing Morrison is too easy, but we aren't given much else from Stone and Kilmer.  Whenever Morrison appears drunken and aggressive in front of the band, watch the faces of the band members.  They know exactly what's wrong with Morrison as they fight the futile battle of getting Morrison sober enough to sing another song.
Calling this movie "The Doors" is misleading. It would be more accurate to call it "Jim Morrison and Those Other Guys In the Band," since that is how it's presented.<br /><br />It's always tempting to latch onto a rock legend in these rock biopics, and Oliver Stone clings like a limpet to the ghost of Jim Morrison. Acid-soaked scenery and mysticism are in every scene, but Stone seems content to wallow in the rock'n'roll debauchery rather than get into Morrison's head.<br /><br />It opens with a voiceover of Jim Morrison's poetry, as we slowly fade into a stalled recording session. Then it flips back to 1949, as Morrison's family drives through the desert. The boy catches a glimpse of several Indians by the road -- and one of them dies as the family leaves.<br /><br />Then it flips ahead to Morrison's (Val Kilmer) years at college -- he crashes a party for a pretty girl, makes arty films, acid-trips, and devotes himself to poetry. Then his pal Ray Manzarek (Kyle McLachlan) creates a rock band, with Morrison's poetry and voice as the centerpiece. Soon The Doors become a fixture in L.A. -- and then a famed band.<br /><br />But as the Doors become more famous, Morrison increasingly loses himself in the messianic-Dionysian-rocker role that has been set out for him. He weds a witch-journalist (Katherine Quinlan) but loves his fey girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). And when he outrages the authorities with the threat of public exposure, the spiral starts that will only lead to death.<br /><br />Stone certainly knew how to evoke the golden ages of rock'n'roll. Lots of sex, kinetic concerts, and bizarre behavior where Morrison jumps up on platforms and screams, "I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!" The whole movie just kind of sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />And Stone is quite brilliant with the direction. The movie is filmed like an acid trip -- shifting multicoloured skies, Indian ghosts, shadows on the sand, and eerie lighting. And it touches on other aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic. The other Doors are relegated to a frame for Morrison's bizarre behavior, and after the first half hour, they basically fade away. And he gets too enamored of his own style with the Indian ghost, and the arty "dead man" final scenes.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a shockingly good job with the languid, unpredictable energy of Morrison. He sings well too. Sadly, his performance is stuck in a one-note character -- Stone opts to potray him just as a random, sleazy, wild jerk, and we don't get a single insight into his thoughts. Sure, Morrison could be horrible. But this is Jim Morrison as rock cliche, not as a human being.<br /><br />And sadly, none of the other actors get much chance to expand on their roles -- the other Doors actors, including MacLachlan, basically play slightly annoyed accessories, and Meg Ryan plays a sweet girl without many other dimensions. Although Crispin Glover has a tiny, memorable role as Andy Warhol.<br /><br />"The Doors" opens into a beautiful psychedelic movie, but Stone fails to give it a soul. It's a fun biopic full of the sixties atmosphere, but it never quite manages to be much more.
The Doors enjoyed another boast in sales in 1991 when this movie came out, but it was a great movie despite the shortcomings that an otherwise unsuspecting teenager (which I was at the time) would have fallen for had it not been for older and wiser peers.<br /><br />Jim Morrison was an otherwise idealistic follow power kid from back East who came to California (as many did at the time and so many afterwards) for fun and sun.  He was more concerned with having fun and being a spacey poet lauriet, even if it was in his own mind.  Here he would meet his love, Pamela, and get together with three friends to form The Doors.  From there, it was all a heady haze of success, fame and self indulgence.  While the other Doors took drugs with him to expand their minds and satisfy their own curiousities, Jim dove head first into full blown addiction.  From there his life would turn into a haze of drug induced behavior, arrests, and lashing out at others.<br /><br />I was glad that this movie made some signifigant points in the history of The Doors.  It was Robby the guitar player, not Jim, who wrote Light My Fire.  They made an historic appearence on the Ed Sullivan Show that outraged the network brass for saying "higher" on their show rather than their censored rewrites.  And there was that infamous show in Miami that turned into an outright embarrassment where he whiped it out and showed us the Ivory White Shaft.  It's not so big a deal nowdays, but back then it was shocking and offensive unlike anyone had ever done.  And Val Kilmer was a dead ringer for the real Jim!<br /><br />What prevented me from giving this 5 stars was the fact that they embellished many things and fabricated many things.  This Jim was really, really rude and unlikable, and I doubt even at his most obnoxiously drunk / high moment he would act so vain and self centered at all times.  That scene where he meets Nico from The Velvet Underground was not true according to many others.  His relationship with the pagan girfriend was left unresolved (although that is her in the pagan wedding scene between him and Kathleen Quinlan), when in real life she would end up aborting his child.  Even his strained relationship with the other Doors was left up in the air once he left for France.  And I have met enough people who really went to Doors concerts back in the day, and they were not really these huge naked drug orgies like they were portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Still, this was a good movie.  Know to see the forrest from the trees, and you will have a better time with it, but don't take it at face value.
The Doors is with out a shadow of a doubt the greatest rock and roll film ever made! It tells perfectly what the late-great Jim Morrison went through and how he lived. This goes into the music and the L.A. scene in the late 1960's. Everything you ever heard about The Doors or Jim Morrison comes across in this movie. The Plot is very east to understand. You find yourself felling bad for Jim because of all the stuff he put himself through, but you also feel bad for the Band because Jim made it to wear Robby, John, and Ray couldnt play their music live because of Jims on stage anticks. I found my self hating Jims wife because if he wouldnt have met her he woulndt have done half of the stuff he did, so was really a bad influence. This is a whats gonna happen next film, and Val Kilmer pulls of the roll flawlessly
Val Kilmer gives a stunning performance. This movie is about how the rock group The Doors came to be. It is mostly told looking through the usually intoxicated and drugged up frontman, Jim Morrison's eyes. You are drawn into his confusing world and see his visions. The casting is incredible. I have never known much about The Doors, but after seeing clips of the real Morrison on the second disk, you realize how well casted Val Kilmer was. Kilmer even sang the songs in the movie. A story that director Oliver Stone tells is how Kilmer challenged him to listen to a recording of him as Jim Morrison and a few songs of Morrison himself and try to guess who was singing which songs. Stone could not tell the difference! The whole band was well cast. Cast interviews and deleted scences are found on the second disk. Oliver Stone did a fine job. I really don't know how else one could tell such a tale or get you to share the high quite like Stone. But Kilmer's work alone warranted a 5 star rating for this movie.
The Doors is one of music's most enduring rock groups, led by one of the 20th century's most interesting personalities Jim Morrison.  The movie, directed by Oliver Stone, is not a biopic, more of an "homage" to the life, and the character of Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The movie details his life, and his rise and fall in music, culminating in his death at 27.<br /><br />The DVD features the same features from the earlier Special Edition, including Oliver Stone's commentary.  Included are 43 minutes or so of deleted scenes and a couple new featurettes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
It kind of reminded me of "Sid and Nancy" (Jim and Pam?), where a lot of liberties were taken to keep the story interesting, and mixed characters up, and the truth is in the music.<br /><br />Ray Manzarek said in an interview that the Miami incident cost his father a promotion, even though Doors money continues to roll in to a father he considered "dead". Jim's background before he became famous to me is more interesting, what led up to the Lizard King that started as a chubby Navy brat. You can also go on You Tube and see some of the projects like "Hwy" he worked on (should be on video, as should "Feast of Friends").<br /><br />"No One Here Gets Out Alive" was where a lot of the story comes from but a lot is left out.<br /><br />As a movie, the music propels it, Morrison's poetry, and Val Kilmer really gets deep into it, definitely one of his most memorable roles, if not THE most. Irony that he was a Navy pilot in "Top Gun" and was the rebel son of a Navy Admiral in this?<br /><br />The members of The Doors all wrote books all worth checking out.
I think this is a great movie. They did a pretty great job with the sound and everything. One thing i didnt like was that some of the opinions in this nivie were different from life. For instance, when the doors appeared on cbs, they were asked not to sing the line " girl we couldnt get much higher". As most know, Jim sung it anyway, but it was an accident. Stone made it appear as it was on purpose. Also that one of the other members was made to look like he hated Jim, ehich was not true
"This is the end, Beautiful friend<br /><br />This is the end, My only friend, the end<br /><br />Of our elaborate plans, the end<br /><br />Of everything that stands, the end<br /><br />No safety or surprise, the end."<br /><br />The moment The Doors' front man Jim Morrisen took acid was the end. Acid, alcohol, and eventually heroin: it all did him in. This is perhaps the most important point made in Oliver Stone's biography of the still-popular title band famed for its lyricist's creativity and unique sound. Early on in the film we see that all of the members are taking acid, experimenting with drugs, etc. but it was Morrison who continued. His bandmates took acid to expand the mind while he maintained the practice till his progressive demise; Stone supposes he took himself and his acid too seriously, and though little exploration into the depths of Morrison's psyche take place otherwise, at least this notion is analyzed persuasively and even movingly.<br /><br />What's initially noticed is Stone's impeccable recreation of the era: the drugs, the sex, the psychedellic sense of style. Stone has always been amazing with visuals but here he really achieves a triumphant grasp of aesthetic milieu. Lighting, color: it contributes to the idea that most of the era was a bizarre mix of acid and something or other. People were twisted, and willingly so. The colors really are mesmerizing, from the Oscar-worthy sets and costumes to Robert Richardson's as-usual excellent DP work. The general motif is an orange-red, a color that suggests The Doors' curiously dark sound again enhancing everything we hear and everything we see.<br /><br />So, it can be said that on a technical level The Doors is an achievement, yet it feels entirely lacking in the area of actual profundity. We never get a true sense of who Jim Morrison is, or who the rest of The Doors are. If anything the film should have been called Morrison or something just as obvious (which is a given in the biopic genre), because really the film is him. Maybe that's the point, since most of what Stone chooses to portray are Morrison's self-indulgences, which actor Val Kilmer performs perfectly (despite his overall superficiality). The rest of the actors do fine with toss-away roles as people in Morrison's life that are simply there to remind us of the real world outside of his halucinogenic brain. It's really a pity because their story is interesting, yet all the information is spread too thin considering the exploration only concerns Morrison and none of the other colorful characters.<br /><br />When the film does stretch at least the imagery is enough to sustain interest. There is a brilliant acid trip sequence in a desert which serves to remind us of the artistry that was (and still is, in some cases) derived from such practices. Native American imagery is intertwined with a riotous concert to emphasize Morrison's shamanism. It is all so compelling, but it can feel a bit wasted. Luckily the images are as memorable in themselves as you would imagine, also featuring the striking image of a dead Jim Morrison engulfed in water, the same orange-red filling the bathroom. Some of the shamanism imagery also provides one of the few forays into Morrison's psyche. Stone effectively portrays his feeling of unification with the shaman lifestyle.<br /><br />In terms of the biopic genre The Doors is...okay, and possibly something I'd watch again. Besides towering triumphs like Raging Bull I haven't come across anything entirely of worth (*cough..Ray...cough*). The Doors, though visually exciting and sometimes involving, is ultimately thin, which is a pity. I love The Doors and Jim Morrison was an interesting man, but Stone just doesn't do their story as much justice as it deserves. Still, given that I've grown to love The Doors I can imagine watching this at late night hang-outs with my best friend Adrienne (she's obsessed). You know? I'd say this is a film for true Doors fans. If you love The Doors you'll watch this film over and over, despite any flaws. If anything Stone manages to portray their mystique and creative aspirations most satisfactorily.
Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison. The name Val Kilmer is, or should be, synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing, but immensely fun and commanding. You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture. Here, he IS The Doors: The Movie. There, he WAS Wonderland. I am exaggerating, i suppose. For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you've experienced what the sixties were like. Through using The Doors actual music (what was missing from the recent Sylvia, the art of the subject itself - her poetry) to help tell its story and colour its scenes, and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison, Stone really takes you into the world of his movie, and the world of the sixties.<p>This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were, and has actually cultivated love in me for their music. I didn't realise they had more than one classic: Light my Fire, The End, People are Strange, Love her Madly, Break on Through to the Other Side, Riders on the Storm, Touch Me, Roadhouse Blues (Let it roll, baby roll) and probably more i'm yet to discover.<p>For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol's factory actually felt like, see I Shot Andy Warhol. Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in &quot;I Shot,&quot; but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation. This, however, is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole.<p>Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo: a young film student, Jim Morrison, shows his short film to his class, who are uncouth and disparaging about it, after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn, (obviously, playing the film professor), who says: &quot;Why don't we ask the author what he thinks?&quot;
My son got me this for last christmas, I already had the vhs version, but this 2 disk set is even better. The interviews with everyone and learning alot more about the movie and everyone who participated in it, and what they really had to say about it, just blew my mind. <p>Still a GREAT movie, Great cast, VAL &amp; MEG awesome job!!! No one could of pulled off playing jim, not like you did! This movie is not only entertaining, the music is awesome, as well as the acting.<p>Any doors fan, will love this, true or not, the movie is awesome!
Oliver Stone an ex Vietnam combatant, a Doors music fan, made an estrordinary work , a great vision of the sixtiees and Jim Morrison's life, great preformes, a worthy Doors movie. Not recomended meet the doors with this movie, is only the vision of a fan.
Kilmer is Morrison in this movie, he acts and feels out what the man did and how he saw the way he did. This is a big winner and I like The Doors myself and this was a good one. Hooray for Oliver Stone for making this awsome movie. Long live Morrison
I loved this movie. Val Kilmer played a killer Jim Morrison...very impressive. Almost true to life.<br />There were some slow parts but all in all this is a great movie!!
